abstract = {A steady decline in Arctic sea ice has been observed over recent decades. General circulation models predict further decreases under increasing greenhouse gas scenarios. Sea ice plays an important role in the climate system in that it influences ocean-to-atmosphere fluxes, surface albedo, and ocean buoyancy. The aim of this study is to isolate the climate impacts of a declining Arctic sea ice cover during the current century. The Hadley Centre Atmospheric Model (HadAM3) is forced with observed sea ice from 1980 to 2000 (obtained from satellite passive microwave radiometer data derived with the Bootstrap algorithm) and predicted sea ice reductions until 2100 under one moderate scenario and one severe scenario of ice decline, with a climatological SST field and increasing SSTs. Significant warming of the Arctic occurs during the twenty-first century (mean increase of between 1.6° and 3.9°C), with positive anomalies of up to 22°C locally. The majority of this is over ocean and limited to high latitu...},

abstract = {A regional atmospheric model with 60-km resolution is asynchronously coupled with a potential vegetation model to study the implications of twenty-first-century climate change for the tropical and subtropical climate and vegetation of South America. The coupled model produces an accurate simulation of the present day climate and vegetation. Future climate is simulated by increasing atmospheric CO2 levels to 757 ppmv and imposing lateral and surface boundary conditions derived from a GCM simulation for 2081-2100 from the Canadian Climate Center GCM. The coupled regional model simulation projects a 70{\%} reduction in the extent of the Amazon rain forest by the end of the twenty-first century and a large eastward expansion of the caatinga vegetation that is prominent in the Nordeste region of Brazil today. These changes in vegetation are related to reductions in annual mean rainfall and a modification of the seasonal cycle that are associated with a weakening of tropical circulation systems},

abstract = {Climate models suggest that extreme precipitation events will become more common in an anthropogenically warmed climate. However, observational limitations have hindered a direct evaluation of model-projected changes in extreme precipitation. We used satellite observations and model simulations to examine the response of tropical precipitation events to naturally driven changes in surface temperature and atmospheric moisture content. These observations reveal a distinct link between rainfall extremes and temperature, with heavy rain events increasing during warm periods and decreasing during cold periods. Furthermore, the observed amplification of rainfall extremes is found to be larger than that predicted by models, implying that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes in response to anthropogenic global warming may be underestimated.},

abstract = {This study provides an overview of projected changes in climate extremes indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The temperature- and precipitation-based indices are computed with a consistent methodology for climate change simulations using different emission scenarios in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) and Phase 5 (CMIP5) multimodel ensembles. We analyze changes in the indices on global and regional scales over the 21st century relative to the reference period 1981–2000. In general, changes in indices based on daily minimum temperatures are found to be more pronounced than in indices based on daily maximum temperatures. Extreme precipitation generally increases faster than total wet-day precipitation. In regions, such as Australia, Central America, South Africa, and the Mediterranean, increases in consecutive dry days coincide with decreases in heavy precipitation days and maximum consecutive 5 day precipitation, which indicates future intensification of dry conditions. Particularly for the precipitation-based indices, there can be a wide disagreement about the sign of change between the models in some regions. Changes in temperature and precipitation indices are most pronounced under RCP8.5, with projected changes exceeding those discussed in previous studies based on SRES scenarios. The complete set of indices is made available via the ETCCDI indices archive to encourage further studies on the various aspects of changes in extremes.},

abstract = {The circulation of the ocean is usually divided into two parts, a wind-driven circulation that dominates in the upper few hundred meters, and a density-driven circulation that dominates below. The latter is called the ‘thermohaline' circulation because of the role of heating, cool- ing, freshening, and salinification in producing regional density differences within the ocean. The thermohaline circulation, for the most part, is an ‘overturning' circulation in which warm water flows poleward near the surface and is subsequently converted into cold water that sinks and flows equatorward in the in- terior. Radiocarbon measurements show that the thermohaline circulation turns over all the deep water in the ocean every 600 years or so},

abstract = {The present study aims at evaluating and comparing precipitation over the Amazon in two sets of historical and future climate simulations based on phase 3 (CMIP3) and 5 (CMIP5) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Thirteen models have been selected in order to discuss (1) potential improvements in the simulation of present-day climate and (2) the potential reduction in the uncertainties of the model response to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. While several features of present-day precipitation—including annual cycle, spatial distribution and co variability with tropical sea surface temperature (SST)—have been improved, strong uncertainties remain in the climate projections. A closer comparison between CMIP5 and CMIP3 highlights a weaker consensus on increased precipitation during the wet season, but a stronger consensus on a drying and lengthening of the dry season. The latter response is related to a northward shift of the boreal summer intertropical convergence zone in CMIP5, in line with a more asymmetric warming between the northern and southern hemispheres. The large uncertainties that persist in the rainfall response arise from contrasted anomalies in both moisture convergence and evapotranspiration. They might be related to the diverse response of tropical SST and ENSO (El Nin˜o Southern Oscillation) variability, as well as to spurious behaviours among the models that show the most extreme response. Model improvements of present-day climate do not necessarily translate into more reliable projections and further efforts are needed for constraining the pattern of the SST response and the soil moisture feedback in global climate scenarios.},

The rainforest usually doesn't experience fires - "Over the past two millenia, major incursions of fire into intact ofrests appear to be associated mainly with exceptionally severe ENSO droughts". 
General climate of the Amazon basin: "the southern, eastern, east-central, and north-central areas are driest" 
The strong ENSO event in 1997 affected the Amazon: "In the central Amazon, rainfall recorded in the 1997 dry season (232 mm) was less than one-third of normal (745 +/- 128 mm), and the number of days without rain nearly double, from an average of 57 to 102." The drought led to increased mortality rates in 20 of 23 sites analyzed in the study. 
Drought increases carbon emissions from rainforests by lowering productivity (due to reduced soil moisture) and increasing respiration rates (due to increased temperatures).
"Large-scale deforestation could cause an estimated 20{\%} decline in Amazonian rainfall".

@article{Cramer2001,
abstract = {The possible responses of ecosystem processes to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change are illustrated using six dynamic global vegetation models that explicitly represent the interactions of ecosystem carbon and water exchanges with vegetation dynamics. The models are driven by the IPCC IS92a scenario of rising CO2 (Wigley et al. 1991), and by climate changes resulting from effective CO2 concentrations corresponding to IS92a, simulated by the coupled ocean atmosphere model HadCM2-SUL. Simulations with changing CO2 alone show a widely distributed terrestrial carbon sink of 1.4{\~{n}}3.8 PgCy{\~{n}}1 during the 1990s, rising to 3.7{\~{n}}8.6 PgCy{\~{n}}1 a century later. Simulations including climate change show a reduced sink both today (0.6{\~{n}} 3.0 PgCy{\~{n}}1) and a century later (0.3{\~{n}}6.6 PgCy{\~{n}}1) as a result of the impacts of climate change on NEP of tropical and southern hemisphere ecosystems. In all models, the rate of increase of NEP begins to level off around 2030 as a consequence of the `diminishing return' of physiological CO2 effects at high CO2 concentrations. Four out of the six models show a further, climate-induced decline in NEP resulting from increased heterotrophic respiration and declining tropical NPP after 2050. Changes in vegetation structure in{\_}uence the magnitude and spatial pattern of the carbon sink and, in combination with changing climate, also freshwater availability (runoff). It is shown that these changes, once set in motion, would continue to evolve for at least a century even if atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate could be instantaneously stabilized. The results should be considered illustrative in the sense that the choice of CO2 concentration scenario was arbitrary and only one climate model scenario was used. However, the results serve to indicate a range of possible biospheric responses to CO2 and climate change. They reveal major uncertainties about the response of NEP to climate change resulting, primarily, from differences in the way that modelled global NPP responds to a changing climate. The simulations illustrate, however, that the magnitude of possible biospheric in{\_}uences on the carbon balance requires that this factor is taken into account for future scenarios of atmospheric CO2 and climate change},

abstract = {We present the global general circulation model IPSL-CM5 developed to study the long-term response of the climate system to natural and anthropogenic forcings as part of the 5th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). This model includes an interactive carbon cycle, a representation of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, and a comprehensive representation of aerosols. As it represents the principal dynamical, physical, and bio- geochemical processes relevant to the climate system, it may be referred to as an Earth System Model. However, the IPSL-CM5 model may be used in a multitude of configurations associated with different boundary condi- tions and with a range of complexities in terms of processes and interactions. This paper presents an overview of the different model components and that the behavior of some components of the climate system such as the Arctic sea ice and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation may change drastically by the end of the twenty-first century in the case of a no climate policy scenario. Although the magnitude of regional temperature and precipitation changes depends fairly linearly on the magnitude of the projected global warming (and thus on the scenario considered), the geographical pattern of these changes is strikingly similar for the different scenarios. The representation of atmospheric physical processes in the model is shown to strongly influence the simulated climate variability and both the magnitude and pattern of the pro- jected climate changes. Keywords explains how they were coupled and used to simulate historical climate changes over the past 150 years and different scenarios of future climate change. A single version of the IPSL-CM5 model (IPSL- CM5A-LR) was used to provide climate projections asso- ciated with different socio-economic scenarios, including the different Representative Concentration Pathways con- sidered by CMIP5 and several scenarios from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios considered by CMIP3. Results suggest that the magnitude of global warming pro- jections primarily depends on the socio-economic scenario considered, that there is potential for an aggressive mitiga- tion policy to limit global warming to about two degrees, and},

abstract = {Quantitative information on the response of global terrestrial net primary production (NPP) to climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 is essential for climate change adaptation and mitigation in the 21st century. Using a process-based ecosystem model (the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model, DLEM), we quantified the magnitude and spatiotemporal variations of contemporary (2000s) global NPP, and projected its potential responses to climate and CO2 changes in the 21st century under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B1 of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We estimated a global terrestrial NPP of 54.6 (52.8-56.4) PgC yr-1 as a result of multiple factors during 2000-2009. Climate change would either reduce global NPP (4.6{\%}) under the A2 scenario or slightly enhance NPP (2.2{\%}) under the B1 scenario during 2010-2099. In response to climate change, global NPP would first increase until surface air temperature increases by 1.5°C (until the 2030s) and then level-off or decline after it increases by more than 1.5°C (after the 2030s). This result supports the Copenhagen Accord Acknowledgement, which states that staying below 2°C may not be sufficient and the need to potentially aim for staying below 1.5°C. The CO2 fertilization effect would result in a 12{\%}-13.9{\%} increase in global NPP during the 21st century. The relative CO2 fertilization effect, i.e. change in NPP on per CO2 (ppm) bases, is projected to first increase quickly then level off in the 2070s and even decline by the end of the 2080s, possibly due to CO2 saturation and nutrient limitation. Terrestrial NPP responses to climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2 largely varied among biomes, with the largest increases in the tundra and boreal needleleaf deciduous forest. Compared to the low emission scenario (B1), the high emission scenario (A2) would lead to larger spatiotemporal variations in NPP, and more dramatic and counteracting impacts from climate and increasing atmospheric CO2.},

abstract = {Future intensification of Amazon drought resulting from climate change may cause increased fire activity, tree mortality, and emissions of carbon to the atmosphere across large areas of Amazonia. To provide a basis for addressing these issues, we examine properties of recent and future meteorological droughts in the Amazon in 35 climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). We find that the CMIP5 climate models, as a group, simulate important properties of historical meteorological droughts in the Amazon. In addition, this group of models reproduces observed relationships between Amazon precipitation and regional sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific and the North Atlantic oceans. Assuming the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario for future drivers of climate change, the models project increases in the frequency and geographic extent of meteorological drought in the eastern Amazon, and the opposite in the West. For the region as a whole, the CMIP5 models suggest that the area affected by mild and severe meteorological drought will nearly double and triple, respectively, by 2100. Extremes of wetness are also projected to increase after 2040. Specifically, the frequency of periods of unusual wetness and the area affected by unusual wetness are projected to increase after 2040 in the Amazon as a whole, including in locations where annual mean precipitation is projected to decrease. Our analyses suggest that continued emissions of greenhouse gases will increase the likelihood of extreme events that have been shown to alter and degrade Amazonian forests.},
annote = {Droughts during the 2000s had a noticeable impact on tree mortality and decreased growth levels. About 1-2{\%} of the carbon stored in the Amazon forests were emitted to the atmosphere as a result. 
Model simulations of response to drought are usually smaller than that's actually observed. There's two explanations for this: "First, most ecosystem models lack a mechanism to represent short-term carbon losses resulting frrom severe drought events....The second explanation relates to the ability of climate models to represent basic drought conditions." 
The authors compare observational data sets to get an estimate of observational uncertainty. They then compare the differences between the models and observations, and find that a fair number of them are performing well in that they have errors within the error estimated due to observational uncertainty. 
"Mean annual precipitation is projected to increase in the western Amazon and to decrease in the eastern part of hte region." The wet months could see more rain and the dry months less, in a regional version of the wet-get-wetter and dry-get-drier convention.
This paper's calculation of a drought index does NOT take into account changes in temperature, only changes in precipitation. 
"The CMIP5 models project about a 10-fold increase by 2100 in the drought area...in regions were mean precipitation is projected to decrease - most of the Amazon basin." This is caused by "a differential warming of SSTs in the eastern tropical Pacific."Alternatively, regions that see increases in precipitation are likely to see increased occurence of "unusual wetness". 
"The recent droughts in 2005 and 2010 in some ways are analogs for projected future conditions. First, droughts of similar intensity... are projected to greatly incrase in frequency; hence the impacts of these recent droughts may ofer some insight into future drought impacts." Also, these particular droughts "were accompanied by unusual wetness in the northeast part of the basin". --{\textgreater} I think this is also good motivational material - are we already seeing what we could expect more of in the future? 
A number of other things impact drought - deforestation, for example, can lower evapotranspiration and thus lower precipitation.},

abstract = {This work presents a new dynamic global vegetation model designed as an extension of an existing surface-vegetation-atmosphere transfer scheme which is included in a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model. The new dynamic global vegetation model simulates the principal processes of the continental biosphere influencing the global carbon cycle (photosynthesis, autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration of plants and in soils, fire, etc.) as well as latent, sensible, and kinetic energy exchanges at the surface of soils and plants. As a dynamic vegetation model, it explicitly represents competitive processes such as light competition, sapling establishment, etc. It can thus be used in simulations for the study of feedbacks between transient climate and vegetation cover changes, but it can also be used with a prescribed vegetation distribution. The whole seasonal phenological cycle is prognostically calculated without any prescribed dates or use of satellite data. The model is coupled to the IPSL-CM4 coupled atmosphere- ocean-vegetation model. Carbon and surface energy fluxes from the coupled hydrology- vegetation model compare well with observations at FluxNet sites. Simulated vegetation distribution and leaf density in a global simulation are evaluated against observations, and carbon stocks and fluxes are compared to available estimates, with satisfying results.},

abstract = {Amazon forests are a key but poorly understood component of the global carbon cycle. If, as anticipated, they dry this century, they might accelerate climate change through carbon losses and changed surface energy balances. We used records from multiple long-term monitoring plots across Amazonia to assess forest responses to the intense 2005 drought, a possible analog of future events. Affected forest lost biomass, reversing a large long-term carbon sink, with the greatest impacts observed where the dry season was unusually intense. Relative to pre-2005 conditions, forest subjected to a 100-millimeter increase in water deficit lost 5.3 megagrams of aboveground biomass of carbon per hectare. The drought had a total biomass carbon impact of 1.2 to 1.6 petagrams (1.2 × 1015 to 1.6 × 1015 grams). Amazon forests therefore appear vulnerable to increasing moisture stress, with the potential for large carbon losses to exert feedback on climate change.},

This paper describes developments to all CCSM components, and docu- ments fully coupled preindustrial control runs compared to the previous version, CCSM3. Using the standard atmosphere and land resolution of 18 results in the sea surface temperature biases in the major upwelling regions being comparable to the 1.48-resolution CCSM3. Two changes to the deep convection scheme in the atmosphere component result in CCSM4 producing El Nin˜o–Southern Oscillation variability with a much more realistic frequency distribution than in CCSM3, although the amplitude is too large compared to ob- servations. These changes also improve the Madden–Julian oscillation and the frequency distribution of tropical precipitation. A new overflow parameterization in the ocean component leads to an improved sim- ulation of the Gulf Stream path and the North Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation. Changes to the CCSM4 land component lead to a much improved annual cycle of water storage, especially in the tropics. The CCSM4 sea ice component uses much more realistic albedos than CCSM3, and for several reasons the Arctic sea ice concentration is improved in CCSM4. An ensemble of twentieth-century simulations produces a good match to the observed September Arctic sea ice extent from 1979 to 2005. TheCCSM4ensemble mean increase in globally averaged surface temperature between 1850 and 2005 is larger than the observed increase by about 0.48C. This is consistent with the fact that CCSM4 does not include a representation of the indirect effects of aerosols, although other factors may come into play. The CCSM4 still has significant biases, such as the mean precipitation distribution in the tropical Pacific Ocean, too much low cloud in the Arctic, and the latitudinal distributions of shortwave and longwave cloud forcings.},

The character of liquid precipitation (defined as a combination of accumulation, frequency, and intensity) over the global oceans is significantly different from the character of liquid precipitation produced by global weather and climate models. Five different models are used in this comparison representing state-of-the-art weather prediction models, state-of-the-art climate models, and the emerging high-resolution global cloud "resolving" models. The differences between observed and modeled precipitation are larger than can be explained by observational retrieval errors or by the inherent sampling differences between observations and models. We show that the time integrated accumulations of precipitation produced by models closely match observations when globally composited. However, these models produce precipitation approximately twice as often as that observed and make rainfall far too lightly. This finding reinforces similar findings from other studies based on surface accumulated rainfall measurements. The implications of this dreary state of model depiction of the real world are discussed.},

abstract = {Global mean temperature is predicted to increase by 2–7 °C and precipitation to change across the globe by the end of this century. To quantify climate effects on ecosystem processes, a number of climate change experiments have been established around the world in various ecosystems. Despite these efforts, general responses of terrestrial ecosystems to changes in temperature and precipitation, and especially to their combined effects, remain unclear. We used meta-analysis to synthesize ecosystem-level responses to warming, altered precipitation, and their combination. We focused on plant growth and ecosystem carbon (C) balance, including biomass, net primary production (NPP), respiration, net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and ecosystem photosynthesis, synthesizing results from 85 studies. We found that experimental warming and increased precipitation generally stimulated plant growth and ecosystem C fluxes, whereas decreased precipitation had the opposite effects. For example, warming significantly stimulated total NPP, increased ecosystem photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration. Experimentally reduced precipitation suppressed aboveground NPP (ANPP) and NEE, whereas supplemental precipitation enhanced ANPP and NEE. Plant productivity and ecosystem C fluxes generally showed higher sensitivities to increased precipitation than to decreased precipitation. Interactive effects of warming and altered precipitation tended to be smaller than expected from additive, single-factor effects, though low statistical power limits the strength of these conclusions. New experiments with combined temperature and precipitation manipulations are needed to conclusively determine the importance of temperature–precipitation interactions on the C balance of terrestrial ecosystems under future climate conditions.},

When the 23 models are forced with either anthropogenic factors or both anthropogenic and external natural factors, approximately 13{\%} of sampled 30-year SPI trends from the models are found to be within the range of the observed SPI trend at 95{\%} confidence level. This suggests a possibility of anthropogenic and external forcing of climate change in the southern Amazon. On average, the models project no changes in the frequency of occurrence of low SPI values in the future; however, those models which produce more realistic SPI climatology, variability and trend over the period 1970-1999 show more of a tendency towards more negative values of SPI in the future.

abstract = {We have observed that the dry-season length (DSL) has increased over southern Amazonia since 1979, primarily owing to a delay of its ending dates (dry-season end, DSE), and is accompanied by a prolonged fire season. A poleward shift of the subtropical jet over South America and an increase of local convective inhibition energy in austral winter (June–August) seem to cause the delay of the DSE in austral spring (September–November). These changes cannot be simply linked to the variability of the tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Although they show some resemblance to the effects of anthropogenic forcings reported in the literature, we cannot attribute them to this cause because of inadequate representation of these processes in the global climate models that were presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report. These models significantly underestimate the variability of the DSE and DSL and their controlling processes. Such biases imply that the future change of the DSE and DSL may be underestimated by the climate projections provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report models. Although it is not clear whether the observed increase of the DSL will continue in the future, were it to continue at half the rate of that observed, the long DSL and fire season that contributed to the 2005 drought would become the new norm by the late 21st century. The large uncertainty shown in this study highlights the need for a focused effort to better understand and simulate these changes over southern Amazonia.},
annote = {This paper assesses dry season length (DSL) over southern Amazonia by looking at the ending date of the dry season (DSE) and the start of it (DSA - dry season arrival). The authors conclude that the DSL has lengtheend since 1979 due to delayed DSE. Primary factors driving this delay include "a poleward shift of the subtropical jet over South America and an increase of local convective inhibition energy in austral winter". The study also notes that CMIP5 models seem to underestimate these changes and therefore may also underestimate future changes. 

"Fifteen percent of global photosynthesis occurs in the Amazon rainforest, where 25{\%} of plant species are found." --{\textgreater} Good motivation. 
Extreme droughts in the Amazon have already occurred in 2005 and 2010. During the 2005 drought, the rainforest "released more than 1 Pg of C to the atmosphere". The rainforest was slow to revoer after this event. 
The DSL has increased att a rate of about 6.5 +/- 2.5 days per decade. 
The fire season in the southern Amazonia is from Aug-Oct, around the time the dry season ends. Delaying the DSE can lead to a lengthened fire season. 
"The observed changes of CIN and SJ{\_}SA [convective inhibition energy and the subtropical south american jet] seem to be broadly consistent with those expected from forcing by greenhouse warming".

abstract = {A Regional Climate Change Index (RCCI), is developed based on regional mean precipitation change, mean surface air temperature change, and change in precipitation and temperature interannual variability. The RCCI is a comparative index designed to identify the most responsive regions to climate change, or Hot-Spots. The RCCI is calculated for 26 land regions from the latest set of climate change projections by 20 global climate models for the A1B, A2 and B1 IPCC emission scenarios. The Mediterranean and North Eastern European regions emerge as the primary Hot-Spots, followed by high latitude northern hemisphere regions and by Central America, the most prominent tropical Hot-Spot. The main African Hot-Spots are Southern Equatorial Africa and the Sahara. Eastern North America is the prominent Hot-Spot over the continental U.S. Different factors over different regions contribute to the magnitude of the RCCI, which is in fact greater than 0 for all regions.},
annote = {This paper calculates a regional climate change index (RCCI) for 26 regions globally, with the RCCI based on changes in temp, precip, temp interannual variability, and precip interannual variability. Changes were calculated for 20 year periods (2080 to 2099) - (1960 to 1979). In the tropics, the biggest RCCI hotspot is in Central America, "with primary contributions to the RCCI coming from a decrease in precipitation and an increase in precipitation variability (as measuered by the coefficient of variation)." 

The RCCI value was taken as the mean over three climate change scenarios analyzed (high medium and low), and so is not directly comparable with what we should see. Regardless, in the Amazon region, this study found an increase in wet season precipitation (Nov-Apr) of 4.02{\%}; but this is compensated for by a decrease in dry season precipitation of 4.49{\%}. Central America sees a decrease of precipitation in both seasons. During the wet season here (May-Oct), the decrease is 9.44{\%}, and uring the dry season (Nov-Apr) the decrease is 17.34{\%}. So we could expect to see larger changes in GPP in Central American than in the Amazon.},

This globally complete, monthly analysis of surface precipitation at 2.5° latitude ? 2.5° longitude resolution is available from January 1979 to the present. It is a merged analysis that incorporates precipitation estimates from low-orbit satellite microwave data, geosynchronous-orbit satellite infrared data, and surface rain gauge observations. The merging approach utilizes the higher accuracy of the low-orbit microwave observations to calibrate, or adjust, the more frequent geosynchronous infrared observations. The dataset is extended back into the premicrowave era (before mid-1987) by using infrared-only observations calibrated to the microwave-based analysis of the later years. The combined satellite-based product is adjusted by the rain gauge analysis. The dataset archive also contains the individual input fields, a combined satellite estimate, and error estimates for each field. This monthly analysis is the foundation for the GPCP suite of products, including those at finer temporal resolution. The 23-yr GPCP climatology is characterized, along with time and space variations of precipitation.},

abstract = {Five anthropogenic drivers--land use change, wood extraction, hunting, atmospheric change, climate change--will largely determine the future of tropical forests. The geographic scope and intensity of these five drivers are in flux. Contemporary land use change includes deforestation (approximately 64,000 km(2) yr(-1) for the entire tropical forest biome) and natural forests regenerating on abandoned land (approximately 21,500 km(2) yr(-1) with just 29{\%} of the biome evaluated). Commercial logging is shifting rapidly from Southeast Asia to Africa and South America, but local fuelwood consumption continues to constitute 71{\%} of all wood production. Pantropical rates of net deforestation are declining even as secondary and logged forests increasingly replace old-growth forests. Hunters reduce frugivore, granivore and browser abundances in most forests. This alters seed dispersal, seed and seedling survival, and hence the species composition and spatial template of plant regeneration. Tropical governments have responded to these local threats by protecting 7{\%} of all land for the strict conservation of nature--a commitment that is only matched poleward of 40 degrees S and 70 degrees N. Protected status often fails to stop hunters and is impotent against atmospheric and climate change. There are increasing reports of stark changes in the structure and dynamics of protected tropical forests. Four broad classes of mechanisms might contribute to these changes. Predictions are developed to distinguish among these mechanisms.},

We propose a detailed evaluation of the ability of the ISBACC (Interaction Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere Carbon Cycle) land surface model to capture drought effects on both water and carbon budgets, comparing fluxes and stocks at two recent throughfall exclusion (TFE) experiments performed in the Amazon. We also explore the model sensitivity to different water stress functions (WSFs) and to an idealized increase in CO2 concentration and/or temperature. In spite of a reasonable soil moisture simulation, ISBACC struggles to correctly simulate the vegetation response to TFE whose amplitude and timing is highly sensitive to the WSF. Under higher CO2 concentrations, the increased water-use efficiency (WUE) mitigates the sensitivity of ISBACC to drought. While one of the proposed WSF formulations improves the response of most ISBACC fluxes, except respiration, a parameterization of drought-induced tree mortality is missing for an accurate estimate of the vegetation response. Also, a better mechanistic understanding of the forest responses to drought under a warmer climate and higher CO2 concentration is clearly needed.},

Previous studies have shown that climate constraints were relaxing with increasing temperature and solar radiation, allowing an upward trend in NPP from 1982 through 1999. The past decade (2000 to 2009) has been the warmest since instrumental measurements began, which could imply continued increases in NPP; however, our estimates suggest a reduction in the global NPP of 0.55 petagrams of carbon. Large-scale droughts have reduced regional NPP, and a drying trend in the Southern Hemisphere has decreased NPP in that area, counteracting the increased NPP over the Northern Hemisphere. A continued decline in NPP would not only weaken the terrestrial carbon sink, but it would also intensify future competition between food demand and proposed biofuel production.},

abstract = {Global warming is expected to lead to a large increase in atmospheric water vapor content and to changes in the hydrological cycle, which include an intensification of precipitation extremes. The intensity of precipitation extremes is widely held to increase proportionately to the increase in atmospheric water vapor content. Here, we show that this is not the case in 21st-century climate change scenarios simulated with climate models. In the tropics, precipitation extremes are not simulated reliably and do not change consistently among climate models; in the extratropics, they consistently increase more slowly than atmospheric water vapor content. We give a physical basis for how precipitation extremes change with climate and show that their changes depend on changes in the moist-adiabatic temperature lapse rate, in the upward velocity, and in the temperature when precipitation extremes occur. For the tropics, the theory suggests that improving the simulation of upward velocities in climate models is essential for improving predictions of precipitation extremes; for the extratropics, agreement with theory and the consistency among climate models increase confidence in the robustness of predictions of precipitation extremes under climate change.},

abstract = {The vulnerability of Amazonian rainforest, and the ecological services it provides, depends on an adequate supply of dry-season water, either as precipitation or stored soil moisture. How the rain-bearing South American monsoon will evolve across the twenty-first century is thus a question of major interest. Extensive savanization, with its loss of forest carbon stock and uptake capacity, is an extreme although very uncertain scenario. We show that the contrasting rainfall projections simulated for Amazonia by 36 global climate models (GCMs) can be reproduced with empirical precipitation models, calibrated with historical GCM data as functions of the large-scale circulation. A set of these simple models was therefore calibrated with observations and used to constrain the GCM simulations. In agreement with the current hydrologic trends, the resulting projection towards the end of the twenty-first century is for a strengthening of the monsoon seasonal cycle, and a dry-season lengthening in southern Amazonia. With this approach, the increase in the area subjected to lengthy - savannah-prone - dry seasons is substantially larger than the GCM-simulated one. Our results confirm the dominant picture shown by the state-of-the-art GCMs, but suggest that the {\^{a}} € model democracy'view of these impacts can be significantly underestimated.},
annote = {Summary: This study uses 36 global climate models and creates a calibrated empirical precipitation model to determine the response of Amazonia to future warming. 
Conclusion: "The resulting projection towards the end of the 21st century is for a strengthening of the monsoon seasonal cycle, and a dry-season lengthening in southern Amazonia." 

Details: 
-The CMIP5 models struggle to simulate precipitation. Over Amazonia, about half simulate a "trend towards wetter conditions" in the next century. The other half show a drying trend (see Figure 1a). 
-Reasons for GCM differences include "model-specific sensitivites in mesoscale circulation and rainfall to phenomena such as El Nino/Southern Oscillation, or to change s in land-ocean temperature contrast." 
-To understand the mechnisms driving changes in amazonian precipitation simulated in the GCMs, the authors look at moisture flux convergence, breaking it down into thermodynamic and dynamic components. The dynamic component seems to correlate strongly with projected precipitation changes (see Figure 1e).
-Results from their empirical model shows "a marked rainfall decline is projected to the end of the twenty-first century in the late dry season,...whereas a moderate Pa increase is diagnosed in the wet season."
-On dry season length: tropicla rainforests dominate when the DSL is less than three months. When DSL increases above three, the amount of forest preesnt decreases. Unfortunately, "both the constrained and GCM projections indicate an expansion of the DSL{\_}3+ area", indicating forest area could decrease.
-The study finds that CMIP5 GCMs tend to underestimated the anthropogenic impacts on Amazonian precipitation. The authors conclude that the rainforest is likely to decline as rainfall lessens in southern Amazonia. But their model doesn't account for land surface feedback, which could be an important feature.},

abstract = {We examine the evidence for the possibility that 21st-century climate change may cause a large-scale "dieback" or degradation of Amazonian rainforest. We employ a new framework for evaluating the rainfall regime of tropical forests and from this deduce precipitation-based boundaries for current forest viability. We then examine climate simulations by 19 global climate models (GCMs) in this context and find that most tend to underestimate current rainfall. GCMs also vary greatly in their projections of future climate change in Amazonia. We attempt to take into account the differences between GCM-simulated and observed rainfall regimes in the 20th century. Our analysis suggests that dry-season water stress is likely to increase in E. Amazonia over the 21st century, but the region tends toward a climate more appropriate to seasonal forest than to savanna. These seasonal forests may be resilient to seasonal drought but are likely to face intensified water stress caused by higher temperatures and to be vulnerable to fires, which are at present naturally rare in much of Amazonia. The spread of fire ignition associated with advancing deforestation, logging, and fragmentation may act as nucleation points that trigger the transition of these seasonal forests into fire-dominated, low biomass forests. Conversely, deliberate limitation of deforestation and fire may be an effective intervention to maintain Amazonian forest resilience in the face of imposed 21st-century climate change. Such intervention may be enough to navigate E. Amazonia away from a possible "tipping point," beyond which extensive rainforest would become unsustainable.},

abstract = {The continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide due to anthropogenic emissions is predicted to lead to significant changes in climate. About half of the current emissions are being absorbed by the ocean and by land ecosystems, but this absorption is sensitive to climate as well as to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, creating a feedback loop. General circulation models have generally excluded the feedback between climate and the biosphere, using static vegetation distributions and CO2 concentrations from simple carbon-cycle models that do not include climate change. Here we present results from a fully coupled, three-dimensional carbon-climate model, indicating that carbon-cycle feedbacks could significantly accelerate climate change over the twenty-first century. We find that under a 'business as usual' scenario, the terrestrial biosphere acts as an overall carbon sink until about 2050, but turns into a source thereafter. By 2100, the ocean uptake rate of 5 Gt C yr(-1) is balanced by the terrestrial carbon source, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations are 250 p.p.m.v. higher in our fully coupled simulation than in uncoupled carbon models, resulting in a global-mean warming of 5.5 K, as compared to 4 K without the carbon-cycle feedback.},

abstract = {There is increasing consensus that the global climate will continue to warm over the next century. The biodiversity-rich Amazon forest is a region of growing concern because many global climate model (GCM) scenarios of climate change forecast reduced pre- cipitation and, in some cases, coupled vegetation models predict dieback of the forest. To date, fires have generally been spatially co-located with road networks and associated human land use because almost all fires in this region are anthropogenic in origin. Climate change, if severe enough, could alter this situation, potentially changing the fire regime to one of increased fire frequency and severity for vast portions of the Amazon forest. High moisture contents and dense canopies have historically made Amazonian forests extremely resistant to fire spread. Climate will affect the fire situation in the Amazon directly, through changes in temperature and precipitation, and indirectly, through climate-forced changes in vegetation composition and structure. The frequency of drought will be a prime determinant of both how often forest fires occur and how extensive they become. Fire risk management needs to take into account landscape configuration, land cover types and forest disturbance history as well as climate and weather. Maintaining large blocks of unsettled forest is critical for managing landscape level fire in the Amazon. The Amazon has resisted previous climate changes and should adapt to future climates as well if landscapes can be managed to maintain natural fire regimes in the majority of forest remnants.},

The skill of several predictors of the pan-Arctic sea ice area was quantified: the sea ice area itself, the pan-Arctic sea ice volume, and some areal predictors built from the subgrid ice thickness distribution (ITD). Sea ice area provides a potential predictability of about 3 months, which is consistent with previous studies using model and observation data. Sea ice volume predictive skill for winter sea ice area prediction is weak. Nevertheless, there is a higher potential to predict the September ice area with the June volume anomaly than with the June area anomaly.

abstract = {It has recently been proposed, within the framework
of the linear shallow-water equations, that tropical
Pacific decadal variability (PDV) can be accounted
for by basin modes with eigenperiods of 10 to 20 yr,
amplifying a midlatitude wind forcing with an
essentially white spectrum. Here the authors use a
different formalism of linear equatorial wave
theory. The Green's function is computed for the
wind-forced response of a linear equatorial
shallow-water ocean and uses the earlier results of
Cane and Moore to obtain a compact, closed form
expression for the motion of the equatorial
thermocline, which applies to all frequencies lower
than seasonal. This expression is new and allows a
systematic comparison of the effect of low- and
high-latitude winds on the equatorial
thermocline. At very low frequencies ( decadal time
scales), the planetary geostrophic solution used by
Cessi and Louazel is recovered, as well as the
equatorial wave solution of Liu, and a formal
explanation for this convergence is
given. Nonetheless, this more general solution leads
one to a different interpretation of the results. In
contrast to the aforementioned studies, the authors
find that the equatorial thermocline is inherently
more sensitive to local than to remote wind forcing
and that planetary Rossby modes only weakly alter
the spectral characteristics of the
response. Tropical winds are able to generate a
strong equatorial response with periods of 10 to 20
yr, while midlatitude winds can only do so for
periods longer than about 50 yr. The results suggest
that ocean basin modes are an unlikely explanation
of decadal fluctuations in tropical Pacific sea
surface temperature.do},

reconstruction of gridded Pacific Ocean Basin sea
surface temperature (SST) from coral stable isotope
(delta(18)O) data for the period 1607-1990. In this
approach we seek to reconstruct only the leading
modes of large-scale variability which are both
observed in the modern climate and resolved in the
proxy data. We find that the coral data verifiably
resolve two spatial patterns of SST variability. The
first and dominant pattern is that of the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). A second pattern
reflects uniform changes over most of the Pacific
Basin. Calibration and verification tests for
1856-1990 show that root-mean-square variance is
small (less than or equal to0.5degreesC RMS) and
reconstruction errors are large (less than or equal
to0.6degreesC RMS), limiting interpretation to the
tropical region. Periods of enhanced ENSO activity
similar to those observed in the past two decades
are evident in the reconstruction for the early
nineteenth century. The changing frequency of ENSO
warm phase events appears to coincide with warming

abstract = {Anew dataset of historical monthly streamflow at the
farthest downstream stations for the world's 925
largest ocean-reaching rivers has been created for
community use. Available new gauge records are added
to a network of gauges that covers similar to 80 x
10(6) km(2) or similar to 80{\%} of global
ocean-draining land areas and accounts for about
73{\%} of global total runoff. For most of the large
rivers, the record for 1948-2004 is fairly
complete. Data gaps in the records are filled
through linear regression using streamflow simulated
by a land surface model [ Community Land Model,
version 3 (CLM3)] forced with observed precipitation
and other atmospheric forcings that are
significantly ( and often strongly) correlated with
the observed streamflow for most rivers. Compared
with previous studies, the new dataset has improved
homogeneity and enables more reliable assessments of
decadal and long-term changes in continental
freshwater discharge into the oceans. The
model-simulated runoff ratio over drainage areas
with and without gauge records is used to estimate
the contribution from the areas not monitored by the
gauges in deriving the total discharge into the
global oceans. Results reveal large variations in
yearly streamflow for most of the world's large
rivers and for continental discharge, but only about
one-third of the top 200 rivers ( including the
Congo, Mississippi, Yenisey, Parana, Ganges,
Columbia, Uruguay, and Niger) show statistically
significant trends during 1948-2004, with the rivers
having downward trends ( 45) outnumbering those with
upward trends ( 19). The interannual variations are
correlated with the El Nino-SouthernnOscillation
(ENSO) events for discharge into the Atlantic,
Pacific, Indian, and global ocean as a whole. For
ocean basins other than the Arctic, and for the
global ocean as a whole, the discharge data show
small or downward trends, which are statistically
significant for the Pacific (-9.4 km(3)
yr(-1)). Precipitation is a major driver for the
discharge trends and large interannual-to-decadal
variations. Comparisons with the CLM3 simulation
suggest that direct human influence on annual
streamflow is likely small compared with climatic
forcing during 1948-2004 for most of the world's
major rivers. For the Arctic drainage areas, upward
trends in streamflow are not accompanied by
increasing precipitation, especially over Siberia,
based on available data, although recent surface
warming and associated downward trends in snow cover
and soil ice content over the northern high
latitudes contribute to increased runoff in these
regions. The results are qualitatively consistent
with climate model projections but contradict an
earlier report of increasing continental runoff
during the recent decades based on limited records.},

Results are compared to the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40). Three aspects have been considered: the influence of the interannual SST variations on the climatological mean state, the response to El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, and the influence on systematic temperature changes. The strongest influence of SST variations has been found for the warm ENSO events considered. Namely, it has been found that the large-scale pattern associated with the extratropical tropospheric response to the ENSO phenomenon during northern winter enhances the forcing and the vertical propagation into the stratosphere of the quasi-stationary planetary waves emerging from the trop...},

Satellite and in situ observations have shown an increase in fire occurrence during drought years and tree mortality following severe droughts, but to date there has been no assessment of long-term impacts of these droughts across landscapes in Amazonia. Here, we use satellite microwave observations of rainfall and canopy backscatter to show that more than 70 million hectares of forest in western Amazonia experienced a strong water deficit during the dry season of 2005 and a closely corresponding decline in canopy structure and moisture. Remarkably, and despite the gradual recovery in total rainfall in subsequent years, the decrease in canopy backscatter persisted until the next major drought, in 2010. The decline in backscatter is attributed to changes in structure and water content associated with the forest upper canopy. The persistence of low backscatter supports the slow recovery ({\textgreater}4 y) of forest canopy structure after the severe drought in 2005. The result suggests that the occurrence of droughts in Amazonia at 5-10 y frequency may lead to persistent alteration of the forest canopy.},

increasing demand and limited supply, and possibly
exacerbated by climate change. Two applications of
dendrochronology to the study of flow variability
are illustrated for an existing 1244-yr
reconstruction of annual flows of the Colorado River
at Lees Ferry, Arizona, USA: (1) identification and
climatological interpretation of rare flow events,
and (2) assessment of vulnerability of water-supply
systems to climatic variability. Analysis centers on
a sustained drought of the mid-1100s characterized
by persistent low flows on both the Colorado and
Sacramento Rivers. Analysis of geopotential height
anomalies during modern joint-droughts suggests more
than one mode of circulation might accompany
joint-drought in the two basins. Monte Carlo
simulation is used to demonstrate that a drought as
severe as that in the 1100s on the Colorado River
might be expected about once in every 4-6 centuries
by chance alone given the time-series properties of
the modern gaged flows. Application of a
river-management model suggests a mid-1100s-style
drought, were it to occur today, would drop
reservoir levels in Lake Mead to dead-pool within a
few decades. Uncertainty presents challenges to
accurately quantifying severe sustained droughts
from streamflow reconstructions, especially early in
the tree-ring record. Corroboration by multiple
proxy records is essential. Future improvements are
likely to require a combination of methodological
advancements and expanded basic data. (C) 2010

Understanding relationships between continental-scale patterns of drought and modes of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) such as El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) may explain how interannual to multidecadal variability in SSTs drives fire at continental scales. We used local wildfire chronologies reconstructed from fire scars on tree rings across western North America and independent reconstructions of SST developed from tree-ring widths at other sites to examine the relationships of multicentury patterns of climate and fire synchrony. From 33,039 annually resolved fire-scar dates at 238 sites (the largest paleofire record yet assembled), we examined forest fires at regional and subcontinental scales. Since 1550 CE, drought and forest fires covaried across the West, but in a manner contingent on SST modes. During certain phases of ENSO and PDO, fire was synchronous within broad subregions and sometimes asynchronous among those regions. In contrast, fires were most commonly synchronous across the West during warm phases of the AMO. ENSO and PDO were the main drivers of high-frequency variation in fire (interannual to decadal), whereas the AMO conditionally changed the strength and spatial influence of ENSO and PDO on wildfire occurrence at multidecadal scales. A current warming trend in AMO suggests that we may expect an increase in widespread, synchronous fires across the western U.S. in coming decades.},

This analysis examines CMIP5 projected changes in the annual cycle of precipitation in monsoon regions, using a moist static energy framework to evaluate competing mechanisms identified to be important in precipitation changes over land. In the presence of sufficient surface moisture, the local response to the increase in downwelling energy is characterized by increased evaporation, increased low-level moist static energy, and decreased stability with consequent increases in precipitation.

abstract = {An array of empirical evidence in the space era, and
in the past, suggests that climate responds to solar
activity. The response mechanisms are thought to be
some combination of direct surface heating, indirect
processes involving UV radiation and the
stratosphere, and modulation of internal climate
system oscillations. A quantitative physical
description is, as yet, lacking to explain the
empirical evidence in terms of the known magnitude
of solar radiative output changes and of climate
sensitivity to these changes. Reproducing
solar-induced decadal climate change requires faster
and larger responses than general circulation models
allow. Nor is the indirect climatic impact of
solar-induced stratospheric change adequately
understood, in part because of uncertainties in the
vertical coupling of the stratosphere and
troposphere. Accounting for solar effects on
pre-industrial surface temperatures requires larger
irradiance variations than present in the
contemporary database, but evidence for significant
secular irradiance change is ambiguous. Essential
for future progress are reliable, extended
observations of the solar radiative output changes
that produce climate forcing. Twenty-five years
after the beginning of continuous monitoring of the
Sun's total radiative output, the Solar Radiation
and Climate Experiment (SORCE) commences a new
generation of solar irradiance measurements with
much expanded capabilities. Relative to historical
solar observations SORCE monitors both total and
spectral irradiance with significantly reduced
uncertainty and increased repeatability, especially
on long time scales. Spectral coverage expands
beyond UV wavelengths to encompass the visible and
near-IR regions that dominate the Sun's radiative
output. The space-based irradiance record, augmented
now with the spectrum of the changes, facilitates
improved characterization of magnetic sources of
irradiance variability, and the detection of
additional mechanisms. This understanding provides a
scientific basis for estimating past and future
irradiance variations, needed for detecting and
predicting climate change.},

abstract = {Progress toward understanding the causes of and
physical mechanisms involved in the 1988 North
American drought is reported. An earlier study
demonstrated that major sea surface temperature
(SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean, in
association with the 1988 La Nina, may have
disrupted atmospheric heating patterns by changing
the location and intensity of the intertropical
convergence zone and that such heating anomalies
could have initiated the circulation anomalies
across North America responsible for the drought. A
key issue of when the drought circulation anomalies
developed and their relation to changes in tropical
Pacific SSTs is examined. Although unusually dry
soil moisture and heat waves persisted into August,
the anomalous atmospheric conditions that brought on
the drought occurred in April, May, and June of
1988. The evolution of the Pacific SSTs and
tropical convection, as revealed by outgoing
longwave radiation, is shown to be consistent with
the development of the conditions favorable for
initiating the drought circulation pattern in April
through June of 1988. On the equator at
110-degrees-W, SST anomalies exceeded
-2.75-degrees-C in only April, May, and June and
were largest (-4.1-degrees-C) in May 1988. The
issues of how the 1988 La Nina differed from those
in the past and the importance of the whole SST
field in determining the anomalous diabatic heating
are also discussed. Diagnostic calculations of
atmospheric diabatic heating confirm that
atmospheric heating anomalies existed in the
tropical Pacific in association with the major SST
anomalies during this time. The link between the
anomalous heating and the tropical SSTs supports the
view that influences external to the atmosphere were
important and that the drought was not generated
solely by mechanisms internal to the atmosphere.
The distribution of diagnosed heating anomalies over
North America, together with a planetary wave model
response to idealized forcing, is described to
clarify the possible role of soil moisture anomalies
in perpetuating the drought. It is argued that
feedback-caused soil moisture anomalies may have
been secondary sources for the drought circulation
but could not have been the primary instigator. For
the most part, other diagnosed heating anomalies
during the drought are found to have little
influence on the North American region. Criteria to
help judge the ability of general circulation models
to simulate the drought are discussed.},

examined. Some factors associated with the
atmosphere's lower boundary conditions that might
influence the interannual variability of the warm

seasonal evolution of the North American monsoon
system is characterized by the regular northward
progression of heavy precipitation from southern
Mexico by early June to the southwestern United
States by early July. While the seasonal normal
rainfall and its variability are largest in
southwest Mexico, the mean seasonal percent
departure from normal is largest in Arizona-New
Mexico. Wet (dry) monsoons in southwest Mexico tend
to occur during La Nina (El Nino). This association
is attributed, in part, to the impact of local sea
surface temperature anomalies on the land-sea
thermal contrast, hence the strength of the
monsoon. There is also a weak association between
dry monsoons in Arizona-New Mexico (northwest
Mexico) and La Nina (El Nino). Wet summer monsoons
in Arizona-New Mexico tend to follow winters
characterized by dry conditions in the southwestern
United States and vice versa. Although the onset

monsoons in Arizona-New Mexico tend to have heavy

seasonal rainfall. However, interannual fluctuations

the southern United States (30-40 degrees N) during
the May-June time period and, to a lesser extent, in
the northern United States (40-50 degrees N) during
the July-August time period. It is strongest in
trends in maximum temperatures (T-max) and 90th
percentile exceedance trends (90PET), and less
pronounced in the T-max 10PET and the corresponding
T-min statistics, and it is robust to changes in
analysis period. Although previous studies suggest
that areas of increased precipitation may have
reduced trends in temperature compared with drier
regions, a change in sign from positive to negative
trends suggests some additional cause. We show that
trends in precipitation may account for some, but
not likely all, of the cause point to evidence that
shows that dynamical patterns (El Nino/Southern
Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, etc.)
cannot account for the observed effects during
May-June. We speculate that changing aerosols,
perhaps related to vegetation changes, and increased
strength of the aerosol direct and indirect effect
may play a role in the observed linkages between
these indices of temperature change and the
hydrologic cycle.},

abstract = {Transformative actions are increasingly being
required to address changes in climate. As an aid to
understanding and supporting informed
decision-making regarding transformative change, we
draw on theories from both the resilience and
vulnerability literature to produce the Adaptation
Action Cycles concept and applied framework. The
resulting Adaptation Action Cycles provides a novel
conceptualisation of incremental and transformative
adaptation as a continuous process depicted by two
concentric and distinct, yet linked, action learning
cycles. Each cycle represents four stages in the
decision-making process, which are considered to be
undertaken over relatively short timeframes. The
concept is translated into an applied framework by
adopting a contextual, actor-focused suite of
questions at each of the four stages. This approach
compliments existing theories of transition and
transformation by operationalising assessments at
the individual and enterprise level. Empirical
validation of the concept was conducted by
collaborating with members of the Australian wine
industry to assess their decisions and actions taken
in response to climate change. The contiguous stages
represented in the Adaptation Action Cycles aptly
reflected the diverse range of decision-making and
action pathways taken in recent years by those
interviewed. Results suggest that incremental
adaptation decision-making processes have distinct
characteristics, compared with those used in
transformative adaptation. We provide empirical data
to support past propositions suggesting dependent
relationships operate between incremental and
transformative scales of adaptation. (C) 2011

abstract = {Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures over the
past 8000 years have been paced by the slow decrease
in summer insolation resulting from the precession
of the equinoxes. However, the causes of superposed
century-scale cold summer anomalies, of which the
Little Ice Age (LIA) is the most extreme, remain
debated, largely because the natural forcings are
either weak or, in the case of volcanism, short
lived. Here we present precisely dated records of
ice-cap growth from Arctic Canada and Iceland
showing that LIA summer cold and ice growth began
abruptly between 1275 and 1300 AD, followed by a
substantial intensification 14301455 AD. Intervals
of sudden ice growth coincide with two of the most
volcanically perturbed half centuries of the past
millennium. A transient climate model simulation
shows that explosive volcanism produces abrupt
summer cooling at these times, and that cold summers
can be maintained by sea-ice/ocean feedbacks long
after volcanic aerosols are removed. Our results
suggest that the onset of the LIA can be linked to
an unusual 50-year-long episode with four large
sulfur-rich explosive eruptions, each with global
sulfate loading {\textgreater}60 Tg. The persistence of cold
summers is best explained by consequent
sea-ice/ocean feedbacks during a hemispheric summer
insolation minimum; large changes in solar
irradiance are not required. Citation: Miller,

the first 6-7 sites achieve half the error reduction
of all 65 sites in the analysis domain. In the
extratropics the reduction of reconstruction error
is small and gradual, while error in the tropical

(NOAA)-series satellites, carrying advanced very
high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) sensors, have
allowed moderate resolution (1 km) measurements of
the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to
be collected from the Earth's land surfaces for over
20 years. Across the conterminous USA, a readily
accessible and decade-long data set is now available
to study many aspects of vegetation activity in,this
region. One feature, the onset of deciduous plant
growth at the start of the spring season (SOS) is of
special interest, as it appears to be crucial for
accurate computation of several important biospheric
processes, and a sensitive measure of the impacts of
global change. In this study, satellite-derived SOS
dates produced by the delayed moving average (DMA)
and seasonal midpoint NDVI (SMN) methods, and
modelled surface phenology (spring indices, SI) were
compared at widespread deciduous forest and mixed
woodland sites during 1990-93 and 1995-99, and these
three measures were also matched to native species
bud-break data collected at the Harvard Forest
(Massachusetts) over the same time period. The
results show that both SOS methods are doing a
modestly accurate job of tracking the general
pattern of surface phenology, but highlight the
temporal limitations of biweekly satellite
data. Specifically, at deciduous forest sites: (1)
SMN SOS dates are close in time to SI first bloom
dates (average bias of +0.74 days), whereas DMA SOS
dates are considerably earlier (average bias of
-41.24 days) and also systematically earlier in late
spring than in early spring; (2) SMN SOS tracks
overall yearly trends in deciduous forests somewhat
better than DMA SOS, but with larger average error
(MAEs 8.64 days and 7.37 days respectively); and (3)
error in both SOS techniques varies considerably by

describes internal climate variability on
interannual and longer time scales is essential to
the ability to predict such variables and detect
periodicities and trends in them. For over 30 yr the
dominant model for background climate variability
has been the autoregressive model of the first order
(AR1). However, recent research has shown that some
aspects of climate variability are best described by
a "long memory" or "power-law" model. Such a model
fits a temporal spectrum to a single power-law
function, which thereby accumulates more power at
lower frequencies than an AR1 fit. In this study,
several power-law model estimators are applied to
global temperature data from reanalysis
products. The methods employed (the detrended
fluctuation analysis, Geweke-Porter-Hudak estimator,
Gaussian semiparametric estimator, and multitapered
versions of the last two) agree well for pure
power-law stochastic processes. However, for the
observed temperature record, the power-law fits are
sensitive to the choice of frequency range and the
intrinsic filtering properties of the methods. The
observational results converge once frequency ranges
are made consistent and the lowest frequencies are
included, and once several climate signals have been
filtered. Two robust results emerge from the
analysis: first, that the tropical circulation
features relatively large power-law exponents that
connect to the zonal-mean extratropical circulation;
and second, that the subtropical lower stratosphere
exhibits power-law behavior that is volcanically
forced.},

abstract = {Various geochemical tracers measured in massive
coral skeletons have the potential to compliment
other sources of high-resolution proxy climate
information (e.g. tree rings, ice cores) by
providing paleoclimatic data from shallow-water
tropical ocean regions. Twenty previously published
coral records (19 delta(18)O and one Sr/Ca series),
between 54 and 346 years in length, were examined
for their local and larger-scale relationships (El
Nino-Southern Oscillation) with climate. Series were
examined in a consistent manner over the same time
periods and relationships were tested for stability
through time. The results demonstrate a spectrum of
climatic interpretation ranging from (1) no
significant relationship of the coral record with
either local or larger-scale climate variables, (2)
significant relationship of the coral record with
climate but the relationship is not stable through
time, and (3) the coral record shows a significant
and temporally stable relationship with climate
which explains a significant and useful proportion
of climate variance. It is concluded that reliance,
to date, on analyzing only one long coral core from
a site has prevented identification of coral records
or parts of coral records where non-climatic factors
are dominating the geochemical signal. Various
factors may cause these non-climatic signals to
dominate. More process studies into how corals of
particular species, with various growth rates and
from various environmental settings incorporate
geochemical tracers into their skeleton are required
to understand exactly what is being measured. In
addition, it is recommended that some level of
replication (ideally, three separate corals) of
geochemical tracers will ensure accurate dating of
the record, identification of periods when
non-climatic factors dominate and thus enhance the
reliability of the paleoclimatic record. Such an
approach will allow the rich archive of
environmental information contained in massive coral
skeletons to make a significant contribution to
high-resolution paleoclimatology and improve our
understanding of the nature and causes of past

the Group Sunspot Number. The Group Sunspot Number
is designed to be more internally self-consistent
(i.e., less dependent upon seeing the tiniest spots)
and less noisy than the Wolf Sunspot Number. It uses
the number of sunspot groups observed, rather than
groups and individual sunspots. Daily, monthly, and
yearly means are derived from 1610 to the
present. The Group Sunspot Numbers use 65 941
observations from 117 observers active before 1874
that were not used by Wolf in constructing his time
series. Hence, we have calculated daily values of
solar activity on 111 358 days for 1610-1995,
compared to 66 168 days for the Wolf Sunspot
Numbers. The Group Sunspot Numbers also have
estimates of their random and systematic errors
tabulated. The generation and preliminary analysis
of the Group Sunspot Numbers allow us to make
several conclusions: (1) Solar activity before 1882
is lower than generally assumed and consequently
solar activity in the last few decades is higher
than it has been for several centuries. (2) There
was a solar activity peak in 1801 and not 1805 so
there is no long anomalous cycle of 17 years as
reported in the Wolf Sunspot Numbers. The longest
cycle now lasts no more than 15 years. (3) The Wolf
Sunspot Numbers have many inhomogeneities in them
arising from observer noise and this noise affects
the daily, monthly, and yearly means. The Group
Sunspot Numbers also have observer noise, but it is
considerably less than the noise in the Wolf Sunspot
Numbers. The Group Sunspot Number is designed to be
similar to the Wolf Sunspot Number, but, even if
both indices had perfect inputs, some differences
are expected, primarily in the daily values.},

of the forest to the combined pressures of
deforestation and global warming is therefore of
great concern(2), especially as some general

we analyse these climate projections with reference
to the 2005 drought in western Amazonia, which was
associated(6) with unusually warm North Atlantic sea

of dry-season ( July - October) rainfall in western
Amazonia correlates well with an index of the north

components: canopy evaporation, evaporation from
bare soils, and transpiration, which is represented
using a canopy and architectural resistance
formulation. Once the latent heat flux has been
computed, the surface energy balance is iterated to
solve for the land surface temperature at each time

The media extensively reported the cold snap, including debate on whether human-induced climate change was partly responsible. Related to this, one particular hypothesis garnered considerable attention: that rapid Arctic sea ice loss may be increasing the risk of cold extremes in the midlatitudes. Here we use large ensembles of model simulations to explore how the risk of North American daily cold extremes is anticipated to change in the future, in response to increases in greenhouse gases and the component of that response solely due to Arctic sea ice loss. Specifically, we examine the changing probability of daily cold extremes as (un)common as the 7 January 2014 event. Projected increases in greenhouse gases decrease the likelihood of North American cold extremes in the future. Days as cold or colder than 7 January 2014 ar...},

abstract = {Observational analyses are performed to examine the
roles of remote and local forcing in the evolutions
of the extreme U.S. summer heat wave-drought cases
of 1980 and 1988. At early stages, both events are
associated with anomalous stationary wave
patterns. Wave activity flux analyses suggest that
in the 1980 case anomalous wave activity propagates
southeastward from an apparent source region to the
south of the Aleutians. The flux pattern is more
complex in the 1988 case but suggests two possible
source regions, one over the central North Pacific
to the north of the Hawaiian Islands and a second
located over the far western Pacific. The 1988
analyses show no anomalous wave propagation out of
the eastern tropical Pacific, although this result
does not necessarily preclude a role for tropical
forcing in generating the anomalous wave train. In
both cases the anomalous wave trains and associated
wave activity fluxes become very weak by early July,
indicating that remotely forced anomalous stationary
waves are unlikely to account for the later stages
of the heat wave-droughts. This leads us to examine
whether these events were enhanced or prolonged by
changes in the local surface energy budget
associated with reductions in evapotranspiration
(ET) over the drought regions, Water vapor budgets
show a systematic decrease in monthly mean ET from
June to August during both events. Comparisons with
nondrought summers support the idea that by late
summer ET rates in both events are anomalously
low. Estimated reductions in surface latent heat
fluxes relative to the control years are
approximately 50 W m(-2) in 1980 and 20 W m(-2) in
1988, with implied increases in sensible heating of
similar magnitudes. Overall, the results indicate
the importance of both dynamical forcing from remote
sources and anomalous local boundary conditions in
accounting for the two extreme heat wave-drought
events. The relative importance of these factors
varies significantly during the evolution of the
events, with remote forcing playing a predominant
role at early stages and anomalous local boundary
conditions assuming increasing importance at later
stages.},

response to future anthropogenic greenhouse gas
emissions. In this study, the atmospheric component
of HadCM3LC is used to assess the role of simulated
changes in mid-twenty-first century sea surface
temperature (SST) in Amazon Basin climate change.
When the full HadCM3LC SST anomalies (SSTAs) are
used, the atmosphere model reproduces the Amazon
Basin climate change exhibited by HadCM3LC,
including much of the reduction in Amazon Basin
rainfall. This rainfall change is shown to be the
combined effect of SSTAs in both the tropical
Atlantic and the Pacific, with roughly equal
contributions from each basin. The greatest rainfall
reduction occurs from May to October, outside of the
mature South American monsoon (SAM) season. This dry
season response is the combined effect of a more
rapid warming of the tropical North Atlantic
relative to the south, and warm SSTAs in the
tropical east Pacific. Conversely, a weak
enhancement of mature SAM season rainfall in
response to Atlantic SST change is suppressed by the
atmospheric response to Pacific SST. This net wet
season response is sufficient to prevent dry season
soil moisture deficits from being recharged through
the SAM season, leading to a perennial soil moisture
reduction and an associated 30{\%} reduction in annual
Amazon Basin net primary productivity (NPP). A
further 23{\%} NPP reduction occurs in response to a
3.5 degrees C warmer air temperature associated with
a global mean SST warming.},

The long-term mean water property and circulation patterns are described, and the local signature of the large-scale 1976–1977 North Pacific climate regime shift is characterized. Changes associated with the climate shift include (1) significant warming in the upper 200–400m of the water column, a decrease in salinity in near-surface coastal waters, and an increase in salinity in subsurface offshore waters; (2) deeper density surfaces and increased stratification throughout the region, particularly within the Southern California Bight; (3) a subtle reorganization of the geostrophic flow structure, including an offshore shift of the California Current and increased nearshore poleward flow; and (4) a cross-shore dichotomy, with the nearshore regime changes occurring primarily during the upwelling season and the offshore variability being of lower frequency than nearer the coast. Changes in the vertical structure of the water column are of particular significance, as they have likely rendered upwelling less biologically effective. This is evident in the temperature and salinity changes, which were greatest (warming and freshening) just above the peak stability changes. There is evidence to suggest that another North Pacific-wide regime shift occurred following the 1997–1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o event, and large ecosystem changes are anticipated. The CalCOFI record is ideally suited for revealing the mechanisms of interdecadal physical–biological interactions in the coastal ocean.},

phenology responds coherently to weather
fluctuations. The resultant LP index confirms the

The paper's purpose is to provide scientific users of the CryoSat data with a description of the design and operation of the SIRAL radar and the CryoSat platform, the data products, and the expected error budget. The ‘low-resolution mode' (LRM), ‘synthetic aperture mode' (SARM) and “synthetic aperture interferometric mode' (SARInM) of the SIRAL radar are described, together with its system parameters, its antenna gain pattern and interferometer phase difference pattern, and its calibration modes. The orbit is described, together with the platform attitude and altitude control law and control systems, and the expected pointing and altitude knowledge. The geographical masks that are used to determine acquisitions in the three SIRAL modes are described. The SIRAL data products, and the processing applied to produce them, are described. Level 1b, level 2 and higher-level products are described in turn, with a particular emphasis on the new procedures applied to the SARInM and SARM processing over ice surfaces. The beam forming and multi-looking is summarised, and a description is given of the behaviour of the SARM and SARInM echoes over idealised surfaces. These inform descriptions of the elevation retrievals of the level 2 processing, including the SARInM retrieval of interferometric phase. The combination of these data, through cross-over analysis over continental ice sheets, and through averaging over sea-ice, to determine areal averages of ice sheet elevation change or sea-ice thickness, is described. The error budget in these higher-level products is described, together with its breakdown into errors arising from the instrument and errors arising from the retrievals. The importance of the co-variance of these errors in determining the final error is stressed. The description of the errors also includes a summary of the experiments required following the launch to validate the CryoSat mission data. An estimate of the mission performance over ice surfaces is made at various spatial scales, and it is concluded that even the relatively short, three-year duration of the CryoSat mission will allow it to make an important scientific contribution, particularly when combined with results from earlier satellite missions.},

abstract = {A suite of divalent metal (Ca, Cd, Ba) carbonates
was synthesized over the temperature range 10-40
degrees C by the classical method of slowly bubbling
N-2 through a bicarbonate solution. It was
discovered that carbonates could be precipitated
reproducibly in or out of isotopic equilibrium with
the environmental solution by varying the
concentrations of bicarbonate and cation,
Precipitation rate had little or no influence on the
isotopic composition of the product. Relatively high
initial concentrations of up to 25 mM in both
bicarbonate and cation were prepared by adding solid
metal chlorides to solutions of NaHCO3. On the basis
of results of equilibrium experiments and a new
determination of the acid fractionation factor, a
new expression is proposed for the oxygen isotope
fractionation between calcite and water at low
temperatures: 10001n alpha(Calcite-H2O) =
18.03(10(3)T(-1))-32.42 where alpha is the
fractionation factor, and T is in kelvins. Combining
new data for low-temperature precipitations and the
high-temperature equilibrium fractionations
published by O'Neil et al. (1969) results in a
revised expression for the oxygen isotope
fractionation between octavite (CdCO3) and water
from 0 degrees to 500 degrees C: 10001n
alpha(CdCO3-H2O) = 2.76(10(6)T(-2))-3.96 The ability
to produce nonequilibrium carbonates allowed
assessment to be made, for the first time, of the
temperature dependence of nonequilibrium stable
isotope fractionations in mineral systems. The
temperature coefficients of cu(carbonate-water) for
nonequilibrium divalent metal carbonates are greater
than those for equilibrium carbonates, a finding
that may bear on the interpretation of analyses of
biogenic carbonates forming out of isotopic

abstract = {Bromine is, per atom, far more efficient than chlorine in destroying stratospheric ozone, and methyl bromide is the single largest source of stratospheric bromine. The two main previously known sources of this compound are emissions from the ocean and from the compound's use as an agricultural pesticide. Laboratory biomass combustion experiments showed that methyl bromide was emitted in the smoke from various fuels tested. Methyl bromide was also found in smoke plumes from wildfires in savannas, chaparral, and boreal forest. Global emissions of methyl bromide from biomass burning are estimated to be in the range of 10 to 50 gigagrams per year, which is comparable to the amount produced by ocean emission and pesticide use and represents a major contribution ( approximately 30 percent) to the stratospheric bromine budget.},

abstract = {The 20th century evolution of basin-wide gradients
in surface ocean properties provides one essential
test for recent models of the interaction between
the Asian monsoon and the tropical ocean, because
various feedback mechanisms should result in
characteristic regional patterns of
variability. Although the instrumental record of
climate variability in the tropics is essentially
limited to the last few decades, the stable isotopic
composition of living corals provides an effective
means for extending the instrumental
observations. Here we present two coral isotopic
records from the Indonesian Maritime Continent, and
we use these records with other previously published
records to describe: (i) the relationship between
western Pacific and central Pacific climate
variability over the past century, with special
emphasis on the biennial band; and (ii) the strength
of the west-east 'Indian Ocean Dipole'. We find that
the amplitude of the biennial cycle in the Pacific
did not vary inversely with the strength of ENSO (El
Nino Southern Oscillation), as might be expected
from some models of monsoonal feedback on the
central Pacific. Instead, the biennial variability
was modulated on decadal timescales throughout much
of the Pacific. We also show that the zonal oxygen
isotopic gradient in the Indian Ocean coral records
was significantly correlated with central Pacific
sea surface temperature on a variety of
timescales. Thus, it is likely that this 'coral
dipole' was a product of strong ENSO-like
teleconnections over the Indian Ocean, as opposed to
being the result of unique Indian Ocean or monsoonal
dynamics. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a coupled instability
of the ocean-atmosphere system in the tropical
Pacific with global impacts. ENSO in the modem world
is briefly described, and the physics of the ENSO
cycle is discussed. Particular attention is given to
the Bjerknes feedback, the instability mechanism
which figures prominently in ENSO past and
future. Our knowledge of ENSO in the paleoclimate
record has expanded rapidly within the last 5
yr. The ENSO cycle is present in all relevant
records, going back 130 kyr. It was systematically
weaker during the early and middle Holocene, and
model studies indicate that this results from
reduced amplification in the late summer and early
fall, a consequence of the altered mean climate in
response to boreal summer perihelion. Data from
corals shows substantial decadal and longer
variations in the strength of the ENSO cycle within
the past 1000 yr; it is suggested that this may be
due to solar and volcanic variations in solar
insolation, amplified by the Bjerknes
feedback. There is some evidence that this feedback
has operated in the 20th century and some model
results indicate that it will hold sway in the
greenhouse future, but it is very far from
conclusive. The comprehensive general circulation
models used for future climate projections leave us
with an indeterminate picture of ENSO's future. Some
predict more ENSO activity, some less, with the
highly uncertain consensus forecast indicating
little change. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

abstract = {The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) has been
calculated for about 30 years as a means of
providing a single measure of meteorological drought
severity. It was intended to retrospectively look at
wet and dry conditions using water balance
techniques. The Standardized Precipitation Index
(SPI) is a probability index that was developed to
give a better representation of abnormal wetness and
dryness than the Palmer indices. Before the user
community will accept the SPI as an alternative to
the Palmer indices, a standard method must be
developed for computing the index. Standardization
is necessary so that all users of the index will
have a common basis for both spatial and temporal
comparison of index values. If different probability
distributions and models are used to describe an
observed series of precipitation, then different SPI
values may be obtained. This article describes the
effect on the SPI values computed from different
probability models as well as the effects on dry
event characteristics. It is concluded that the
Pearson Type III distribution is the "best"
universal model, and that the reliability of the SPI
is sample size dependent. It is also concluded that
because of data limitations, SPIs with time scales
longer than 24 months may be unreliable. An internet

warming, this enables the RCMs to capture the
response of transient eddies to increased
atmospheric stability that allows more moisture to
converge on the windward side of the mountains by
blocking. As a result, RCMs simulate enhanced
transient eddy moisture convergence in the SW

drying due to enhanced moisture divergence by the
divergent mean flow in a warmer climate. This
enhanced convergence leads to reduced susceptibility
to hydrological change in the RCMs compared to

Although these cold winters are thought to be partly driven by dramatic losses of Arctic sea-ice, the mechanism that links sea-ice loss to cold winters remains a subject of debate. Here, by conducting observational analyses and model experiments, we show how Arctic sea-ice loss and cold winters in extra-polar regions are dynamically connected through the polar stratosphere. We find that decreased sea-ice cover during early winter months (November– December), especially over the Barents–Kara seas, enhances the upward propagation of planetary-scale waves with wavenumbers of 1 and 2, subsequently weakening the strato-spheric polar vortex in mid-winter (January–February). The weakened polar vortex preferentially induces a negative phase of Arctic Oscillation at the surface, resulting in low temperatures in mid-latitudes.},

southwest Western Australia (SWWA) in 2010 saw a
continuation of the multidecade-long winter drought
plaguing the region. During this season, the highest
recorded positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM) value
was measured, adding weight to an association of a
positive SAM with anomalously low SWWA winter
rainfall (SWR), and vice-versa. However, such a
SAM-SWR teleconnection has been recently
questioned. Using observational data in the
post-1979 satellite era, it is shown that such a SAM
influence does exist. This coherence is confirmed
with 1150 years of modelled 20th century SWR
anomalies and SAM values from 23 climate models,
showing that a nonlinear impact operates: the
influence from a negative SAM is greater than that
from a positive SAM. This explains why a small
positive shift in the SAM can cause a large SWR
reduction, as has been observed. A further test
shows that models with a greater positive SAM trend
systematically produce a greater future SWR
reduction. As all climate models project an increase
in the SAM these results suggest that as global
warming continues unabated, SWWA winter droughts
will be more persistent as atmospheric conditions
become more unfavourable for drought-breaking

A positive AO weakens the basin-scale anticyclonic sea ice drift and decreases the winter ice thickness by 15cm and 10cm in the Eurasian and the Pacific sectors of the Arctic respectively. Three reanalysis datasets show that the upward surface heat fluxes are reduced over wide areas of the Arctic, suppressing the ice growth during the positive AO winters. The winter dynamic and thermodynamic thinning preconditions the ice for enhanced radiative forcing via the ice-albedo feedback in late spring–summer, leading to an additional 10 cm of thinning over the Pacific sector of the Arctic.

abstract = {The response of the tropical Pacific Ocean to future
climate change remains highly uncertain, in part
because of the disagreement among observations and
coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) regarding
20th-century trends. Here we use forward models of
climate proxies to compare CGCM simulations and
proxy observations to address 20th-century trends
and assess remaining uncertainties in both proxies
and models. We model coral oxygen isotopic
composition (delta O-18) in a 23-site Indo-Pacific
network as a linear function of sea-surface
temperature (SST) and sea-surface salinity (SSS)
obtained from historical marine observations
(instrumental data) and a multimodel ensemble of
20th-century CGCM output. When driven with
instrumental data from 1958 to 1990, the forward
modeled corals (pseudocorals) capture the spatial
pattern and temporal evolution of the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Comparison of the
linear trend observed in corals and instrumental
pseudocorals suggests that the trend in corals
between 1958 and 1990 results from both warming
(60{\%}) and freshening (40{\%}). From 1890 to 1990, the
warming/freshening trend in CGCM pseudocorals is
weaker than that observed in corals. Corals display
a moderate trend towards a reduced zonal SST
gradient and decreased ENSO-related variance between
1895 and 1985, whereas CGCM pseudocorals display a
range of trend patterns and an increase in
ENSO-related variance over the same
period. Differences between corals and CGCM
pseudocorals may arise from uncertainties in the
linear bivariate coral model, uncertainties in the
way corals record climate, undersensitivity of CGCMs
to radiative forcing during the 20th century, and/or
biases in the simulated CGCM SSS fields. Citation:

@article{tourre99_interdecadal,
abstract = {Interdecadal variability in sea level pressure (SLP)
and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the
Pacific Ocean was "quasiperiodic" from 1900-91. The
coherent variability of this phenomenon is
investigated using gridded observational data from
the turn of the century (SST and SLP) and of upper
ocean heat content (HS) from the recent two and a
half decades. The nominal cycle in atmosphere-ocean
variables is roughly two decades long, but growth
and decay can happen on a shorter timescale (e.g.,
half a cycle or so). The authors divide the full
cycle into four phases: An onset phase, during which
a weak SLP anomaly pattern off Japan takes
approximately 2-4 yr to expand eastward, leads to
large SLP anomalies in the region of the Aleutian
low. A quasistationary growth phase, with the
midlatitude SLP anomaly pattern in the eastern
ocean, intensifies over a 2-4 yr period. The
persistent SLP anomalies evolve in concert with
large SST (and HS anomalies) of the same polarity
located to the south-southwest along the subarctic
frontal zone (SAFZ). During the growth phase, SST
anomalies with opposite polarity develop to the
east, associated with anomalous atmospheric
circulation along the North American coastline. Near
the end of the growth phase a narrow tongue of
enhanced SST anomalies is found along the
subtropical front near Hawaii, slightly to the west
of the subduction region associated with the
subtropical gyre. Following is a decay phase during
which the midocean SST and SLP anomalies weaken,
while the HS anomalies persist in the southern part
of the subtropical gyre. Concomitantly, a weak
anomalous east-west SLP gradient is established in
the tropical Pacific and could contribute to the
interdecadal variability of the southern oscillation
index. Finally, a return phase occurs (identical to
the onset phase but with opposite polarity), during
which SST anomalies move from the Alaskan gyre and
from the center of the subtropical gyre to merge
onto the SAFZ. During the evolution of the
interdecadal phenomenon, the overall structure of
IIS highlights the notion that the subtropical gyre
integrates the thermal and dynamical forcing induced
by the persistent surface circulation anomaly. Since
only the oceanic anomalies retain their character
throughout the seasonal cycle, the interdecadal
phenomenon may owe its existence to coupled
ocean-atmosphere interaction in which ocean surface
anomalies feed back on the atmosphere providing the
necessary links between consecutive winter
seasons. It is suggested that this can occur through
interactions in either midlatitudes
(delayed-negative feedback) and/or the Tropics.},

abstract = {The Southern Oscillation (SO) is usually described
as the atmospheric component of the dynamically
coupled El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. The
contention in this work, however, is that dynamical
coupling is not required to produce the
SO. Simulations with atmospheric general circulation
models that have varying degrees of coupling to the
ocean are used to show that the SO emerges as a
dominant mode of variability if the atmosphere and
ocean are coupled only through heat and moisture
fluxes. Herein this mode of variability is called
the thermally coupled Walker (TCW) mode. It is a
robust feature of simulations with atmospheric
general circulation models (GCMs) coupled to simple
ocean mixed layers. Despite the absence of
interactive ocean dynamics in these simulations, the
spatial patterns of sea level pressure, surface
temperature, and precipitation variability
associated with the TCW are remarkably
realistic. This mode has a red spectrum indicating
persistence on interannual to decadal time scales
that appears to arise through an off-equatorial
trade wind-evaporation-surface temperature feedback
and cloud shortwave radiative effects in the central
Pacific. When dynamically coupled to the ocean (in
fully coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs), the main
change to this mode is increased interannual
variability in the eastern equatorial Pacific sea
surface temperature and teleconnections in the North
Pacific and equatorial Atlantic, though not all
coupled GCMs simulate this effect. Despite the
oversimplification due to the lack of interactive
ocean dynamics, the physical mechanisms leading to
the TCW should be active in the actual climate
system. Moreover, the robustness and realism of the
spatial patterns of this mode suggest that the
physics of the TCW can explain some of the primary
features of observed interannual and decadal
variability in the Pacific and the associated global
teleconnections.},

abstract = {South Asian emissions of fossil fuel SO2 and black
carbon increased≈6-fold since 1930, resulting in
large atmospheric concentrations of black carbon and
other aerosols. This period also witnessed strong
negative trends of surface solar radiation, surface
evaporation, and summer monsoon rainfall. These
changes over India were accompanied by an increase
in atmospheric stability and a decrease in sea
surface temperature gradients in the Northern Indian
Ocean. We conducted an ensemble of coupled
ocean-atmosphere simulations from 1930 to 2000 to
understand the role of atmospheric brown clouds in
the observed trends. The simulations adopt the
aerosol radiative forcing from the Indian Ocean
experiment observations and also account for global
increases in greenhouse gases and sulfate
aerosols. The simulated decreases in surface solar
radiation, changes in surface and atmospheric
temperatures over land and sea, and decreases in
monsoon rainfall are similar to the observed
trends. We also show that greenhouse gases and
sulfates, by themselves, do not account for the
magnitude or even the sign in many instances, of the
observed trends. Thus, our simulations suggest that
absorbing aerosols in atmospheric brown clouds may
have played a major role in the observed regional
climate and hydrological cycle changes and have
masked as much as 50{\%} of the surface warming due to
the global increase in greenhouse gases. The
simulations also raise the possibility that, if
current trends in emissions continue, the
subcontinent may experience a doubling of the
drought frequency in the coming decades.},

are analyzed using a soil moisture-based drought
index over global terrestrial areas, excluding
Greenland and Antarctica. The soil moisture fields
are derived from a simulation of the terrestrial
hydrologic cycle driven by a hybrid
reanalysis-observation forcing dataset. Drought is
described in terms of various statistics that
summarize drought duration, intensity, and
severity. There is an overall small wetting trend in
global soil moisture, forced by increasing
precipitation, which is weighted by positive soil
moisture trends over the Western Hemisphere and
especially in North America. Regional variation is
nevertheless apparent, and significant drying over
West Africa, as driven by decreasing Sahel
precipitation, stands out. Elsewhere, Europe appears
to have not experienced significant changes in soil
moisture, a trait shared by Southeast and southern
Asia. Trends in drought duration, intensity, and
severity are predominantly decreasing, but
statistically significant changes are limited in
areal extent, of the order of 1.0{\%}-7.0{\%} globally,
depending on the variable and drought threshold, and
are generally less than 10{\%} of continental
areas. Concurrent changes in drought spatial extent
are evident, with a global decreasing trend of
between -0.021{\%} and -0.035{\%} yr(-1). Regionally,
drought spatial extent over Africa has increased and
is dominated by large increases over West
Africa. Northern and East Asia show positive trends,
and central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau show
decreasing trends. In South Asia all trends are
insignificant. Drought extent over Australia has
decreased. Over the Americas, trends are uniformly
negative and mostly significant. Within the
long-term trends there are considerable interannual
and decadal variations in soil moisture and drought
characteristics for most regions, which impact the
robustness of the trends. Analysis of detrended and
smoothed soil moisture time series reveals that the
leading modes of variability are associated with sea
surface temperatures, primarily in the equatorial
Pacific and secondarily in the North
Atlantic. Despite the overall wetting trend there is
a switch since the 1970s to a drying trend, globally
and in many regions, especially in high northern
latitudes. This is shown to be caused, in part, by
concurrent increasing temperatures. Although drought
is driven primarily by variability in precipitation,
projected continuation of temperature increases
during the twenty-first century indicate the
potential for enhanced drought occurrence.},

(1806-1978) from the island of Espiritu Santo
(Republic of Vanuatu). Although this record
contained information in the pentadal-decadal band,
low sampling resolution raised questions about the
validity of the results. Herein we report new data
from the Santo record, in which the sampling
resolution has been doubled and the validation
database expanded. Variations in coral delta(18)O at
Santo record the combined effects of variations in
SST and rainfall-induced salinity changes. The most
prominent spectral peaks in the time series are at
the annual cycle and 14-15 and 7.4 years. The robust
occurrence of the 14-15 year peak provides
additional support to the importance of this
oscillation as a cause of decadal-scale climate
variability. Overall, our new results provide
greater credibility to the conclusions raised in the
earlier study and indicate that the Santo record can
more confidently be incorporated into the
still-small network of multicentury coral records of
climate change.},

large wildfires in the western United States, an
observation supported by palaeoecological data on
charcoal in lake sediments and reconstructions from
fire-scarred trees. Although current fire management
focuses on fuel reductions to bring fuel loadings
back to their historical ranges, at the regional
scale extreme fire weather is still the dominant
influence on area burned and fire severity. Current
forecasting tools are limited to short-term
predictions of fire weather but increased
understanding of large-scale oceanic and atmospheric
patterns in the Pacific Ocean (e.g., El Nino
Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation)
may improve our ability to predict climatic
variability at seasonal to annual
leads. Associations between these quasi-periodic
patterns and fire occurrence, though evident in some
regions, have been difficult to establish in
others. Increased temperature in the future will
likely extend fire seasons throughout the western
United States, with more fires occurring earlier and
later than is currently typical, and will increase
the total area burned in some regions. If climatic
change increases the amplitude and duration of
extreme fire weather we can expect significant
changes in the distribution and abundance of
dominant plant species in some ecosystems, which
would thus affect habitat of some sensitive plant
and animal species. Some species that are sensitive
to fire may decline, whereas the distribution and
abundance of species favored by fire may be
enhanced. The effects of climatic change will
partially depend on the extent to which resource
management modifies vegetation structure and fuels.},

abstract = {The application of stable isotopes in speleothem
records requires an understanding of the extent to
which speleothem calcite isotopic compositions
reflect the compositions of the cave waters from
which they precipitate. To test for equilibrium
precipitation, modern speleothem calcite was grown
on glass plates, so that the carbon and oxygen
isotope composition of the calcite and the water
from which it precipitated could be directly
compared. The plates were placed on the tops of
three actively growing stalagmites that occupy a 1
m(2) area in Harrison's Cave, Barbados, West
Indies. Only some of the plate delta(13)C values and
none of the plate delta(18)O values correspond to
equilibrium values, indicating significant kinetic
isotope effects during speleothem calcite growth. We
investigate herein mechanisms that may account for
the kinetic isotope effects. On each plate,
speleothem calcite was deposited with distinct
delta(18)O and delta(13)C compositions that increase
progressively away from the growth axis, with up to
6.6 parts per thousand C-13 and 1.7 parts per
thousand O-18 enrichments. The positive delta(13)C
versus delta(18)O trends are likely a result of O-18
and C-13 Rayleigh-distillation enrichment in the
HCO3- reservoir owing to progressive CO2 degassing
and CaCO3 precipitation. The magnitude of the
delta(13)C versus 8180 slope is likely controlled by
the extent to which CO2 hydration-hydroxylation
reactions buffer the oxygen isotope composition of
the HCO3- reservoir during calcite
precipitation. Complete oxygen isotopic buffering of
the HCO3- reservoir by CO2 hydration-hydroxylation
reactions will produce a vertical delta(13)C versus
delta(18)O slope in calcite sampled along a growth
layer. As oxygen isotope buffering of the HCO3-
reservoir decreases to no buffering, the delta(13)C
versus delta(13)O slope in calcite sampled along a
growth layer will decrease from vertical to 0.52 at
the cave temperature. In this study, modern
speleothem calcite sampled along the growth layer
produced a delta(13)C versus delta(18)O slope of
3.9, indicating incomplete oxygen isotope buffering
of the HCO3- reservoir during calcite precipitation.
Both modern and Holocene speleothem calcite from
Barbados, sampled temporally along the growth axis,
shows similar positive delta(13)C versus delta(18)O
slopes. These results, along with the spatial
variations in glass plate calcite carbon and oxygen
isotope compositions, suggest that the isotopic
composition of the Holocene speleothems is in part
controlled by non-equilibrium isotope effects. In
addition, there is a correlation between stalactite
length and oxygen and carbon isotope ratios of
calcite precipitated on the corresponding stalagmite
and glass plate, which may be due to C-13 and O-18
enrichment of the HCO3- reservoir during CO,
degassing-calcite precipitation along the
overhanging stalactite. We compiled 165 published
speleothem stable isotope records with a global
distribution and found that most of these records
show a positive covariation between delta(13)C and
delta(18)O values. Speleothem stable isotope records
may be influenced by kinetic isotope effects such
that temperature-controlled equilibrium
fractionation models alone cannot directly explain
the significance of the variations in these
records. Advancing the interpretation of these
records requires the calibration of cave
environmental conditions with the nonequilibrium
isotope effects that cause delta(13)C and delta(18)O
covariations in speleothems.},

However, observations of mean ice thickness have been sparse in time and space, making the construction of observation-based time series difficult. Moreover, different groups use a variety of methods and processing procedures to measure ice thickness, and each observational source likely has different and poorly characterized measurement and sampling errors. Observational sources used in this study include upward-looking sonars mounted on submarines or moorings, electromagnetic sensors on helicopters or aircraft, and lidar or radar altimeters on airplanes or satellites. Here we use a curve-fitting approach to determine the large-scale spatial and temporal variability of the ice thickness as well as the mean differences between the observation systems, using over 3000 estimates of the ice thickness. The thickness estimates are measured over spatial scales of approximately 50 km or time scales of 1 month, and the primary time period analyzed is 2000–2012 when the modern mix of observations is available. Good agreement is found between five of the systems, within 0.15 m, while systematic differences of up to 0.5 m are found for three others compared to the five.

precipitation-dominated regions, with the spatial
pattern of change strongly resembling that of the

amplification of the global hydrological

surfaces are attributable to both isopycnal heave
and real water-mass modification of the
temperature-salinity relationship. Subduction and
circulation by the ocean's mean flow of surface
salinity and temperature anomalies appear to account
for most regional subsurface salinity changes on
isopycnals. Broad-scale surface warming and the
associated poleward migration of isopycnal outcrops
drive a clear and repeating pattern of subsurface

abstract = {The El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drives substantial variability in rainfall, severe weather, agricultural production, ecosystems and disease in many parts of the world. Given that further human-forced changes in the Earth's climate system seem inevitable, the possibility exists that the character of ENSO and its impacts might change over the coming century. Although this issue has been investigated many times during the past 20 years, there is very little consensus on future changes in ENSO, apart from an expectation that ENSO will continue to be a dominant source of year-to-year variability. Here we show that there are in fact robust projected changes in the spatial patterns of year-to-year ENSO-driven variability in both surface temperature and precipitation. These changes are evident in the two most recent generations of climate models, using four different scenarios for CO2 and other radiatively active gases. By the mid- to late twenty-first century, the projections include an intensification of both El-Ni{\~{n}}o-driven drying in the western Pacific Ocean and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. Experiments with an Atmospheric General Circulation Model reveal that robust projected changes in precipitation anomalies during El Ni{\~{n}}o years are primarily determined by a nonlinear response to surface global warming. Uncertain projected changes in the amplitude of ENSO-driven surface temperature variability have only a secondary role. Projected changes in key characteristics of ENSO are consequently much clearer than previously realized.},

Be-10 allows to reconstruct total solar irradiance

Region-wide fires were not consistently associated with specific phase combinations of ENSO and the PDO. Any conclusion that extensive wildfires are more or less common when the PDO is in one phase or the other depends entirely on the choice of PDO reconstruction.

the sign of anomalies in several fields. Large sea
surface temperature anomalies of opposite signs
existed in the tropical Pacific with strong La Nina
conditions in 1988 and a mature EI Nino in 1993. The
distribution of tropical convection in the
convergence zones and associated latent healing of
the atmosphere were correspondingly altered,
implying a large scale switch in the anomalous
tropical heating and forcing of extratropical quasi
stationary waves in the atmosphere, influencing the
subtropical jet stream over the North Pacific and
across North America. In 1988 the jet stream and the
closely related storm track of high-frequency
disturbances in the upper troposphere were displaced
into Canada well north of the normal location-the
farthest north of any year from 1979 to 1993. in
1993 a broader jet stream and the storm track were
displaced well south of normal to a more springlike
location across the United States the farthest south
by over 200 km of any year from 1979 to
1993. High-frequency eddy activity in the
Pacific-North American storm track is shown to
reinforce the anomalous jet streams in both
years. An analysis of the moisture budgets reveals a
stronger river of atmospheric moisture flowing
across the Gulf of Mexico into the central and
eastern United States Ln 1993. Also, in the lower
atmosphere, the storm track in 1993 was mon active,
and its lower latitude allowed the cyclonic
disturbances to tap into the moisture source,
transport moisture into the upper Mississippi River
basin, and precipitate it out. It is deduced that
local evaporation may have enhanced the
precipitation and helped perpetuate and prolong the
conditions. In contrast, in 1988 disturbances were
weaker and displaced far enough north to avoid most
of the moisture source, and the drought was
perpetuated by the dry conditions. Consequently,
these effects should be viewed as feedbacks that
amplify and prolong the response, while from the
standpoint of the atmosphere, the anomalous tropical
Pacific sea surface temperatures are a notable (but
not the sole) external forcing of the patterns .},

strength of the atmospheric overturning circulation
decreases as the climate warms in all IPCC AR4
models, in a manner consistent with the
thermodynamic scaling arguments of Held and
Soden. The weakening occurs preferentially in the
zonally asymmetric (i.e., Walker) rather than
zonal-mean (i.e., Hadley)component of the tropical

changes to the thermal structure and circulation of
the tropical oceans. Evidence suggests that the
overall circulation weakens by decreasing the
frequency of strong updrafts and increasing the
frequency of weak updrafts, although the robustness
of this behavior across all models cannot be
confirmed because of the lack of data. As the
climate warms, changes in both the atmospheric and
ocean circulation over the tropical Pacific Ocean
resemble "El Nino-like" conditions; however, the
mechanisms are shown to be distinct from those of El
Nino and are reproduced in both mixed layer and full
ocean dynamics coupled climate models. The character
of the Indian Ocean response to global warming

adopted here is that the land surface model should
be able to provide not only reasonable diurnal
variations of surface heat fluxes as surface
boundary conditions for coupled models, but also
correct seasonal evolutions of soil moisture in the
context of a long-term data assimilation system. In
a similar way to that in which the modified Oregon
State University land surface model (LSM) has been
used in the NCEP global and regional forecast
models, it is implemented in MM5 to facilitate the
initialization of soil moisture. Also, 1-km
resolution vegetation and soil texture maps are
introduced in the coupled MM5-LSM system to help
identify vegetation/water/ soil characteristics at
fine scales and capture the feedback of these land
surface forcings. A monthly varying climatological
0.15 degrees x 0.15 degrees green vegetation
fraction is utilized to represent the annual control
of vegetation on the surface
evaporation. Specification of various vegetation and
soil parameters is discussed, and the available
water capacity in the LSM is extended to account for
subgrid-scale heterogeneity. The coupling of the LSM
to MM5 is also sensitive to the treatment of the
surface layer, especially the calculation of the
roughness length for heat/moisture. Including the
effect of the molecular sublayer can improve the
simulation of surface heat flux. It is shown that
the soil thermal and hydraulic conductivities and
the surface energy balance are very sensitive to
soil moisture changes. Hence, it is necessary to
establish an appropriate soil moisture data
assimilation system to improve the soil moisture

@article{schubert04_long_term_drought,
abstract = {The U.S. Great Plains experienced a number of
multiyear droughts during the last century, most
notably the droughts of the 1930s and 1950s. This
study examines the causes of such droughts using
ensembles of long-term (1930-2000) simulations
carried out with the NASA Seasonal-to-Interannual
Prediction Project (NSIPP-1) atmospheric general
circulation model (AGCM) forced with observed sea
surface temperatures (SSTs). The results show that
the model produces long-term (multiyear) variations
in precipitation in the Great Plains region
(30degrees-50degreesN, 95degrees-105degreesW) that
are similar to those observed. A correlative
analysis suggests that the ensemble-mean
low-frequency (time scales longer than about 6 yr)
rainfall variations in the Great Plains are linked
to a pan-Pacific pattern of SST variability that is
the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) in
the low-frequency SST data. The link between the SST
and the Great Plains precipitation is confirmed in
idealized AGCM simulations, in which the model is
forced by the two polarities of the pan-Pacific SST
pattern. The idealized simulations further show that
it is primarily the tropical part of the SST
anomalies that influences the Great Plains. As such,
the Great Plains tend to have above-normal
precipitation when the tropical Pacific SSTs are
above normal, while there is a tendency for drought
when the tropical SSTs are cold. The
upper-tropospheric response to the pan-Pacific SST
EOF shows a global-scale pattern with a strong wave
response in the Pacific and a substantial zonally
symmetric component in which U. S. Great Plains
pluvial (drought) conditions are associated with
reduced (enhanced) heights throughout the
extratropics. The potential predictability of
rainfall in the Great Plains associated with SSTs is
rather modest, with about one-third of the total
low-frequency rainfall variance being forced by SST
anomalies. Further idealized experiments with
climatological SST suggest that the remaining
low-frequency variance in the Great Plains
precipitation is the result of interactions with
soil moisture. In particular, simulations with soil
moisture feedback show a fivefold increase in the
variance in annual Great Plains precipitation
compared with simulations in which the soil feedback
is excluded. In addition to increasing variance, the
interactions with the soil introduce a year-to-year
memory in the hydrological cycle. The impact of soil
memory is consistent with a red noise process, in
which the deep soil is forced by white noise and
damped with a time scale of about 1.5 yr. As such,
the role of low-frequency SST variability is to
introduce a bias to the net forcing on the soil
moisture that drives the random process
preferentially to either wet or dry conditions.},

abstract = {In this paper, the assimilation of binary observations calculated from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of sea ice is investigated. Ice and water observations are obtained from a set of SAR images by thresholding ice and water probabilities calculated using a supervised maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). These ice and water observations are then assimilated in combination with ice concentration from passive microwave imagery for the purpose of estimating sea ice concentration. Due to the fact that the observations are binary, consisting of zeros and ones, while the state vector is a continuous variable (ice concentration), the forward model used to map the state vector to the observation space requires special consideration. Both linear and non-linear forward models were investigated. In both cases, the assimilation of SAR data was able to produce ice concentration analyses in closer agreement with image analysis charts than when assimilating passive microwave data only.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}An observation product for thin sea ice thickness (SMOS-Ice) is derived from the brightness temperature data of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. This product is available in near-real time, at daily frequency, during the cold season. In this study, we investigate the benefit of assimilating SMOS-Ice into the TOPAZ coupled ocean and sea ice forecasting system, which is the Arctic component of the Copernicus marine environment monitoring services. The TOPAZ system assimilates sea surface temperature (SST), altimetry data, temperature and salinity profiles, ice concentration, and ice drift with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The conditions for assimilation of sea ice thickness thinner than 0.4 m are favorable, as observations are reliable below this threshold and their probability distribution is comparable to that of the model. Two parallel Observing System Experiments (OSE) have been performed in March and November 2014, in which the thicknesses from SMOS-Ice (thinner than 0.4 m) are assimilated in addition to the standard observational data sets. It is found that the root mean square difference (RMSD) of thin sea ice thickness is reduced by 11 {\%} in March and 22 {\%} in November compared to the daily thin ice thicknesses of SMOS-Ice, which suggests that SMOS-Ice has a larger impact during the beginning of the cold season. Validation against independent observations of ice thickness from buoys and ice draft from moorings indicates that there are no degradations in the pack ice but there are some improvements near the ice edge close to where the SMOS-Ice has been assimilated. Assimilation of SMOS-Ice yields a slight improvement for ice concentration and degrades neither SST nor sea level anomaly. Analysis of the degrees of freedom for signal (DFS) indicates that the SMOS-Ice has a comparatively small impact but it has a significant contribution in constraining the system ({\&}gt; 20 {\%} of the impact of all ice and ocean observations) near the ice edge. The areas of largest impact are the Kara Sea, Canadian Archipelago, Baffin Bay, Beaufort Sea and Greenland Sea. This study suggests that the SMOS-Ice is a good complementary data set that can be safely included in the TOPAZ system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Severe drought is the greatest recurring natural disaster to strike
North America. A remarkable network of centuries-long annual tree-ring
chronologies has now allowed for the reconstruction of past drought over
North America covering the past 1000 or more years in most regions.
These reconstructions reveal the occurrence of past ``megadroughts{\{}''{\}}
of unprecedented severity and duration, ones that have never been
experienced by modem societies in North America. There is strong
archaeological evidence for the destabilizing influence of these past
droughts on advanced agricultural societies, examples that should
resonate today given the increasing vulnerability of modem water-based
systems to relatively short-term droughts. Understanding how these
megadroughts develop and persist is a timely scientific problem. Very
recently, climate models have succeeded in simulating all of the major
droughts over North America from the Civil War to the severe 1998-2004
drought in the western U.S. These numerical experiments indicate the
dominating importance of tropical Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures
(SSTs) in determining how much precipitation falls over large parts of
North America. Of central importance to drought formation is the
development of cool ``La Nina-like{\{}''{\}} SSTs in the eastern tropical
Pacific region. This development appears to be partially linked to
changes in radiative forcing over that region, which affects the
Bjerknes feedback mechanism of the ENSO cycle there. Paradoxically,
warmer conditions over the tropical Pacific region lead to the
development of cool La Nina-like SSTs there, which is drought inducing
over North America. Whether or not this process will lead to a greater
prevalence of drought in the future as the world warms due to
accumulating greenhouse gases is unclear at this time. (c) 2007 Elsevier

chronologies from overlapping segments of
cross-dated ring-width series is reviewed, with an
emphasis on preserving very low-frequency signals

fundamental statistical problem coined the 'segment
length curse' is introduced. This 'curse' is related
to the fact that the maximum wavelength of
recoverable climatic information is ordinarily
related to the lengths of the individual tree-ring
series used to construct the millennia-long
chronology. Simple experiments with sine waves are
used to illustrate this fact. This is followed by
more realistic experiments using a long bristlecone
pine series that is randomly cut into a number of
1000-, 500- and 200-year segments and standardized
using three very conservative methods. When compared
against the original, uncut series, the resulting
'chronologies' show the effects of segment length
even when the most conservative and noncommittal
method of tree-ring standardization is applied
(i.e., a horizontal line through the
mean). Alternative schemes of chronology development
are described that seek to exorcise the segment
length curse. While they show some promise, none is
universal in its applicability and this problem
still remains largely unsolved.},

Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) predict very different
changes of rainfall over the Amazon under the SRES
A1B scenario for global climate change. Five of the
eleven models predict an increase of annual
rainfall, three models predict a decrease of
rainfall, and the other three models predict no
significant changes in the Amazon rainfall. We have
further examined two models. The UKMO-HadCM3 model
predicts an El Nino-like sea surface temperature
(SST) change and warming in the northern tropical
Atlantic which appear to enhance atmospheric
subsidence and consequently reduce clouds over the
Amazon. The resultant increase of surface solar
absorption causes a stronger surface sensible heat
flux and thus reduces relative humidity of the
surface air. These changes decrease the rate and
length of wet season rainfall and surface latent
heat flux. This decreased wet season rainfall leads
to drier soil during the subsequent dry season,
which in turn can delay the transition from the dry
to wet season. GISS-ER predicts a weaker SST warming
in the western Pacific and the southern tropical
Atlantic which increases moisture transport and
hence rainfall in the Amazon. In the southern Amazon
and Nordeste where the strongest rainfall increase
occurs, the resultant higher soil moisture supports
a higher surface latent heat flux during the dry and
transition season and leads to an earlier wet season
onset.},

abstract = {The Murray-Darling Basin is Australia's food bowl
and home to many iconic water bodies that are
culturally and ecologically highly valued. The
recent Millennium Drought (from mid-1990s to 2009)
was the most severe hydrological drought since
records started in the late 19th century. It
severely impacted on the basin and for many acted as
a wake-up call. To address the ongoing declines in
water resources and environmental conditions and to
prepare the region for climate change, Australia's
Governments are currently attempting to introduce a
new comprehensive, and integrated approach to the
management of the basin's water resources. In this
paper, long-term time series of climate,
hydrological and environmental data are used to
analyze how compounding stresses have gradually
affected the hydrological system and its
services. Major hydroclimatic stresses considered in
this paper include salinity, water use, droughts,
and climate change. Other, more localized or minor
stresses exist (groundwater extraction, farm dams,
afforestation, bush fires, cyanobacterial blooms and
pollutants) and are reviewed more briefly. The
history of water policy and planning shows that
Government actions have been strongly influential on
the basin. A shift in the strategic goals from water
development to the protection and restoration of
environmental assets is noticeable since the mid
1990s. Median climate change projections by 2030
indicate smaller reductions in rainfall and runoff
than those observed during the recent Millennium
Drought, but have a relatively high uncertainty
attached to them. The use of regional approaches to
reduce that uncertainty, such as statistical
downscaling, points to a sizeable decline in
rainfall by the end of the century. Most climate
projections used for planning consider greenhouse
emission scenarios that have smaller global emission
trends than the one observed over the last
decade. Other, 'less optimistic' scenarios have to
be considered for long-term water planning and food
security. Compounding all these stresses, is the
naturally high hydroclimatic variability of this
semi-arid region, that may have been insufficiently
considered during previous water development and
planning efforts. Successful water planning will
need to balance cultural and ecological values with
food production, account for high natural
variability and uncertainty in climate change
projections, learn from past mistakes and be
cognizant of future hydrological changes. (C) 2011

abstract = {In spite of the unprecedented quantity and quality
of meteorological data and numerical models, there
is still no consensus about the atmosphere's
elementary statistical properties as functions of
scale in either time or in space. This review paper
proposes a new synthesis based on a) advances in the
last 25 years in nonlinear dynamics, b) a critical
re-analysis of empirical aircraft and vertical sonde
data, c) the systematic scale by scale, space-time
exploitation of high resolution remotely sensed data
and d) the systematic re-analysis of the outputs of
numerical models of the atmosphere including
reanalyses, e) a new turbulent model for the
emergence of the climate from "weather" and climate
variability. We conclude that Richardson's old idea
of scale by scale simplicity today embodied in
multiplicative cascades can accurately explain the
statistical properties of the atmosphere and its
models over most of the meteorologically significant
range of scales, as well as at least some of the
climate range. The resulting space-time cascade
model combines these nonlinear developments with
modern statistical analyses, it is based on strongly
anisotropic and intermittent generalizations of the
classical turbulence laws of Kolmogorov, Corrsin,
Obukhov, and Bolgiano. Crown Copyright (C) 2010

annual variation in temperature, increase from -10

abstract = {The easterly Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) is a
prominent climate feature over the Intra-America
Seas, and it is associated with much of the water
vapor transport from the tropical Atlantic into the
Caribbean Basin. In this study, the North American
Regional Reanalysis (NARR) is analyzed to improve
the understanding of the dynamics of the CLLJ and
its relationship to regional rainfall
variations. Horizontal momentum balances are
examined to understand how jet variations on both
diurnal and seasonal time scales are controlled. The
jet is geostrophic to the first order. Its
previously documented semidiurnal cycle (with minima
at about 0400 and 1600 LT) is caused by semidiurnal
cycling of the meridional geopotential height
gradient in association with changes in the westward
extension of the North Atlantic subtropical high
(NASH). A diurnal cycle is superimposed, associated
with a meridional land-sea breeze (solenoidal
circulation) onto the north coast of South America,
so that the weakest jet velocities occur at 1600
LT. The CLLJ is present throughout the year, and it
is known to vary in strength semiannually. Peak
magnitudes in July are related to the seasonal cycle
of the NASH, and a second maximum in February is
caused by heating over northern South America. From
May through September, zonal geopotential gradients
associated with summer heating over Central America
and Mexico induce meridional flow. The CLLJ splits
into two branches, including a southerly branch that
connects with the Great Plains low-level jet (GPLLJ)
bringing moisture into the central United
States. During the rest of the year, the flow
remains essentially zonal across the Caribbean Basin
and into the Pacific. A strong (weak) CLLJ is
associated with reduced (enhanced) rainfall over the
Caribbean Sea throughout the year in the NARR. The
relationship with precipitation over land depends on
the season. Despite the fact that the southerly
branch of the CLLJ feeds into the meridional GPLLJ
in May through September, variations in the CLLJ
strength during these months do not impact
U.S. precipitation, because the CLLJ strength is
varying in response to regional-scale forcing and
not to changes in the large-scale
circulation. During the cool season, there are
statistically significant correlations between the
CLLJ index and rainfall over the United States. When
the CLLJ is strong, there is anomalous northward
moisture transport across the Gulf of Mexico into
the central United States and pronounced rainfall
increases over Louisiana and Texas. A weak jet is
associated with anomalous westerly flow across the
southern Caribbean region and significantly reduced
rainfall over the south-central United States. No
connection between the intensity of the CLLJ and
drought over the central United States is
found. There are only three drought summers in the
NARR period (1980, 1988, and 2006), and the CLLJ was
extremely weak in 1988 but not in 1980 or 2006.},

QDO was associated with global average upper ocean
temperature variability dominated by the tropical
global average from 20 degrees S to 20 degrees
N. Earlier diagnosis of the tropical global average

tendency driven not by the radiative forcing

quasi-decadal sensible plus latent heat flux
(similar to 0.5 W m(-2)) from the overlying
troposphere. Now we diagnose the corresponding
thermal budget of the tropical global average
atmospheric temperature variability, finding it
largest in the lower stratosphere (similar to 0.8
degrees K), decreasing downward into the lower
troposphere (similar to 0.15 degrees K) and the
upper ocean (similar to 0.05 degrees K). These
diagnostics find quasi- decadal temperature
variability in the tropical lower stratosphere
arising from a thermal balance between anomalous
radiative forcing (1.0 - 1.5 W m(-2)) by ozone
absorption of the 11-year signal in solar UV
irradiance variability (modified by absorption of
mean solar IR irradiance by volcanic aerosol
variability) and variable longwave radiation and
vertical advection. The latter two processes altered
the vertical gradient of equivalent potential
temperature in the tropical troposphere that allowed
mean vertical circulation to drive an anomalous

latter matched the amplitude and phase of the
downward quasi- decadal sensible plus latent heat

The extended theory conserves both ice mass and thermal energy, in the form of the heat stored in the ice, by jointly solving a thickness-distribution equation and an enthalpy-distribution equation. Both equations have been implemented in a one-dimensional dynamic thermodynamic sea-ice model with 12 ice thickness categories following the numerical procedure of Hibler. The implementation of the enthalpy-distribution equation allows the sea-ice model to account for any changes in the ice thermal energy induced by sea ice processes. As a result, the model is able to conserve not only the ice mass but also its thermal energy in the presence of ice advection, growth, melting, and ridging. Conserving ice thermal energy in a thickness-distribution sea ice model improves the prediction of ice growth, summer ice melt in particular, and therefore ice thickness. Inability to...},

abstract = {The U. S. Climate Variability and Predictability
(CLIVAR) working group on drought recently initiated
a series of global climate model simulations forced
with idealized SST anomaly patterns, designed to
address a number of uncertainties regarding the
impact of SST forcing and the role of
land-atmosphere feedbacks on regional drought. The
runs were carried out with five different
atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) and
one coupled atmosphere-ocean model in which the
model was continuously nudged to the imposed SST
forcing. This paper provides an overview of the
experiments and some initial results focusing on the
responses to the leading patterns of annual mean SST
variability consisting of a Pacific El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO)-like pattern, a pattern that
resembles the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation
(AMO), and a global trend pattern. One of the key
findings is that all of the AGCMs produce broadly
similar (though different in detail) precipitation
responses to the Pacific forcing pattern, with a
cold Pacific leading to reduced precipitation and a
warm Pacific leading to enhanced precipitation over
most of the United States. While the response to the
response over the United States tends to occur when
the two oceans have anomalies of opposite
signs. Further highlights of the response over the
United States to the Pacific forcing include
precipitation signal-to-noise ratios that peak in
spring, and surface temperature signal-to-noise
ratios that are both lower and show less agreement
among the models than those found for the
precipitation response. The response to the positive
SST trend forcing pattern is an overall surface
warming over the world's land areas, with
substantial regional variations that are in part
reproduced in runs forced with a globally uniform
SST trend forcing. The precipitation response to the
trend forcing is weak in all of the models. It is
hoped that these early results, as well as those
reported in the other contributions to this special
issue on drought, will serve to stimulate further
analysis of these simulations, as well as suggest
new research on the physical mechanisms contributing
to hydroclimatic variability and change throughout

abstract = {The effect of air-sea coupling on tropical climate
variability is investigated in a coupled linear
inverse model (LIM) derived from the simultaneous
and 6-day lag covariances of observed 7-day running
mean departures from the annual cycle. The model
predicts the covariances at all other lags. The
predicted and observed lag covariances, as well as
the associated power spectra, are generally found to
agree within sampling uncertainty. This validates
the LIM's basic premise that beyond daily time
scales, the evolution of tropical atmospheric and
oceanic anomalies is effectively linear and
stochastically driven. It also justifies a linear
diagnosis of air-sea coupling in the system. The
results show that air-sea coupling has a very small
effect on subseasonal atmospheric variability. It
has much larger effects on longer-term variability,
in both the atmosphere and the ocean, including
greatly increasing the amplitude of ENSO and
lengthening its dominant period from 2 to 4
years. Consistent with these results, the
eigenvectors of the system's dynamical evolution
operator also separate into two distinct, but
nonorthogonal, subspaces: one governing the nearly
uncoupled subseasonal dynamics and the other
governing the strongly coupled longer-term
dynamics. These subspaces arise naturally from the
LIM analysis; no bandpass frequency filtering need
be applied. One implication of this remarkably clean
separation of the uncoupled and coupled dynamics is
that GCM errors in anomalous tropical air-sea
coupling may cause substantial errors on interannual
and longer time scales but probably not on the
subseasonal scales associated with the MJO.},

But it remains difficult to assess the likelihood of future changes in the thermohaline circulation, mainly owing to poorly constrained model parameterizations and uncertainties in the response of the climate system to greenhouse warming. Analyses of past abrupt climate changes help to solve these problems. Data and models both suggest that abrupt climate change during the last glaciation originated through changes in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation in response to small changes in the hydrological cycle. Atmospheric and oceanic responses to these changes were then transmitted globally through a number of feedbacks. The palaeoclimate data and the model results also indicate that the stability of the thermohaline circulation depends on the mean climate state.},

abstract = {In 2005, large sections of southwestern Amazonia
experienced one of the most intense droughts of the
last hundred years. The drought severely affected
human population along the main channel of the
Amazon River and its western and southwestern
tributaries, the Solimoes (also known as the Amazon
River in the other Amazon countries) and the Madeira
Rivers, respectively. The river levels fell to
historic low levels and navigation along these
rivers had to be suspended. The drought did not
affect central or eastern Amazonia, a pattern
different from the El Nino-related droughts in 1926,
1983, and 1998. The choice of rainfall data used
influenced the detection of the drought. While most
datasets (station or gridded data) showed negative
departures from mean rainfall, one dataset exhibited
above-normal rainfall in western Amazonia. The
causes of the drought were not related to El Nino
but to (i) the anomalously warm tropical North
Atlantic, (ii) the reduced intensity in northeast
trade wind moisture transport into southern Amazonia
during the peak summertime season, and (iii) the
weakened upward motion over this section of
Amazonia, resulting in reduced convective
development and rainfall. The drought conditions
were intensified during the dry season into
September 2005 when humidity was lower than normal
and air temperatures were 3 degrees-5 degrees C
warmer than normal. Because of the extended dry
season in the region, forest fires affected part of
southwestern Amazonia. Rains returned in October
2005 and generated flooding after February 2006.},

The Arctic decreases are so definitive that there has not been a monthly record high in Arctic sea-ice extents in any month since 1986, a time period during which there have been 75 monthly record lows. The Antarctic, with the opposite but weaker trend toward increased ice extents, experienced monthly record lows in 5months of 1986, then 6 later monthly record lows scattered through the dataset, with the last two occurring in 2006, versus 45 record highs since 1986. However, in the last three years of the 1979–2015 dataset, the downward trends in Arctic sea-ice extents eased up, with no new record lows in any month of 2013 or 2014 and only one record low in 2015, while the upward trends in Antarctic ice extents notably strengthened, with new record high ice extents in 4months (August–November) of 2013, in 6months (April–September) of 2014, and in 3months (January, April, and May) of 2015.

Yet large year-to-year fluctuation are also present in the September SIE and the mechanism for this variability is still not clear. Here we address this issue by examining the preconditions in meteorological fields in the previous spring and summer from observations and a large ensemble of historical climate model simulations. The focus of this study is the impact on the September SIE from moisture transport into the Arctic and the associated surface energy fluxes. We find that the below-normal September SIE is associated with enhanced moisture transport into the Arctic in spring, which induces downward thermal radiation at the surface. However, in summer the anomalous moisture transport over the Arctic is divergent due to an anticyclonic atmospheric flow pattern and the surface albedo feedback plays a leading role.},

long-term change(s) in circulation in the SW

for the three months of April, May, and June 1988
during which the Great Plains region of the United
States experienced one of its most severe droughts
in history. It is found that during this period the
April-June (AMJ) seasonal-mean anomaly was not
representative of the variability of 10-day low-pass
anomalies. Rather, over North America large
fluctuations on monthly and shorter timescales
occurred, with the dominant streamfunction anomalies
not strongly anticyclonic until June. In fact, the
AMJ anomaly was dominated by two episodes of rapidly
developing, intense anomalous anticyclones in early
and late June. Examination of the daily 10-day
low-pass streamfunction anomalies at 300 mb suggests
that propagating Rossby waves originating in the
west Pacific played a dominant role in the
initiation of these intense anomalous
anticyclones. Numerical experiments with a linear,
time-dependent, barotropic model also support this
hypothesis. These results suggest that the AMJ
anomaly, which has been characterized as a wave
train seemingly forced in the east Pacific, may not
provide a useful picture of the circulation
associated with the drought. Instead, the drought
may be better studied not as a single seasonal
event, but rather as a succession of events that
together produced a serious hydrological deficit.y},

percent of the variance in the instrumental record,

suggests that the instrumental record of streamflow
for Middle Boulder Creek is not representative of
flow in past centuries and that several low flow
events in the 19th century were more persistent than
any in the 20th century. The 1840s to early 1850s
period of low flow is a particularly notable event

In this study, heading or flowering dates of winter wheat cultivar Kharkof are examined from 70 years of data at six locations in the U.S. Great Plains. Results indicate a consistent trend of earlier heading or flowering dates across all sites, but rates of the trend differ (from 0.8 to 1.8 days per 10-year). Because the heading or flowering date is governed primarily by temperatures, the earlier heading or flowering dates indicate warming temperatures in the spring. Further examinations reveal increase in spring daily minimum temperatures.

abstract = {Recent large-scale palaeoclimate reconstructions of
past temperature have been essentially biased to the
extratropics owing to a paucity of proxy data in
tropical regions. Herein we describe the first
coral-based reconstruction of sea surface
temperatures (SSTs) for the whole of the tropics (30
degrees N-30 degrees S). It was developed from 14
disparate coral records located in the Indian and
Pacific oceans. Over the most replicated period, the
reconstruction explains 57{\%} of the tropical SST
variance. However, the strength of this signal
weakens markedly as the number of coral records
decreases. The reconstruction is robust between 1850
and 1993, but some fidelity is indicated back as far
as the mid 18th century. These results suggest that
ambiguities in the low frequency domain of delta
O-18 measurements can be partially overcome by
pooling together multiple time series from different
locations around the tropics. Agreement with
simulations from two general circulation models
indicates that the late 20th century is likely the
warmest period in the tropics for the last 250
years, and that this recent warming can only be
explained by anthropogenic forcing. The high
frequency variability is dominated by the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation. The reconstruction, owing
to the small number of coral records, is
unfortunately restricted both in time and
space. Therefore we hope that this study will spur
the palaeoclimate community to develop new and
longer proxy series to improve the current meager
data-base of temperature sensitive series in the
tropics.},

range of factors, such as natural variability and

the most recent decades. This relationship accounts
for up to 40{\%} of the variability on interannual to

meridional circulation south of Australia that
simultaneously produces a northward flow of
relatively cool, dry air to southwest Western
Australia and a southward flow of warm, moist air to
East Antarctica. This pattern of meridional flow is
consistent with some projections of circulation
changes arising from anthropogenic climate
change. The precipitation anomaly of the past few
decades in Law Dome is the largest in 750 years, and
lies outside the range of variability for the record

abstract = {Atmospheric methyl bromide (CH3Br) and methyl chloride (CH3Cl), compounds that are involved in stratospheric ozone depletion, originate from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Current estimates of CH3Br and CH3Cl emissions from oceanic sources, terrestrial plants and fungi, biomass burning and anthropogenic inputs do not balance their losses owing to oxidation by hydroxyl radicals, oceanic degradation, and consumption in soils, suggesting that additional natural terrestrial sources may be important. Here we show that CH3Br and CH3Cl are released to the atmosphere from all vegetation zones of two coastal salt marshes. We see very large fluxes of CH3Br and CH3Cl per unit area: up to 42 and 570 micromol m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The fluxes show large diurnal, seasonal and spatial variabilities, but there is a strong correlation between the fluxes of CH3Br and those of CH3Cl, with an average molar flux ratio of roughly 1:20. If our measurements are typical of salt marshes globally, they suggest that such ecosystems, even though they constitute less than 0.1{\%} of the global surface area, may produce roughly 10{\%} of the total fluxes of atmospheric CH3Br and CH3Cl.},

Here the relationship between the forced responses and the dominant pattern of internally generated atmospheric variability is focused on. The total response is partioned into a portion that projects onto the leading mode of internal variability (the indirect response) and a portion that is the residual from that projection (the direct response). This empirical decomposition yields physically meaningful patterns whose distinctive horizontal and vertical structures imply different governing mechanisms. The indirect response, which dominates the total geopotential height response, is hemispheric in scale with resemblance to the North Atlantic Oscillation or Northern Hemisphere annular mode, and equivalent barotropic in the vertical from the surface to the tropopaus...},

This paper presents the European Phenology Network (EPN), which aims to increase the efficiency, added value and use of phenological monitoring and research, and to promote the practical use of phenological data in assessing the impact of global (climate) change and possible adaptation measures. The paper demonstrates that many disciplines have to deal with changes in the timing of life-cycle events in response to climate change and that many different user groups are involved. Furthermore, it shows how EPN addresses issues such as (1) raising public awareness and education, (2) the integration and co-operation of existing observing systems, (3) integration and access to phenological information and (4) communication.},

This variation is dominated by the seasonal changes over the Antarctic Ocean where the second (semiannual) harmonic of the mid-tropospheric meridional temperature gradient has a magnitude exceeding that of the first (annual) harmonic. The existence of the marked semiannual component in this region is shown to be a consequence of the difference between the heating and cooling rates in different latitudes where the mid-tropospheric annual temperature ranges are similar. In latitude 50S cooling in autumn is rapid compared with the warming in spring, the reverse being true at latitude 65S. This behavior is related to the heat budget of the oceanic upper layers.

Only minor differences are found in the primary analysis variables such as free atmospheric geopotential height and winds in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, while significant improvements upon NCEP-NCAR reanalysis are made in land surface parameters and land-ocean fluxes. This analysis can be used as a supplement to the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis especially where the original analysis has problems.

abstract = {Seasonal movements of the Intertropical Convergence
Zone (ITCZ) control precipitation patterns and cloud
cover throughout the tropics. In this study we have
reconstructed seasonal and interannual variability
of the eastern Pacific ITCZ from 1984 to 1707 using
subseasonal deltaO-18 analyses on a massive coral
from Secas Island (7-degrees 59'N, 82-degrees 3'W)
in the Gulf of Chiriqui, Panama'. The land area that
drains into the Gulf of Chiriqui has served to
amplify the rainfall effect on nearshore surface
waters and coral deltaO-18 composition. During the
protracted wet season in Panama, the deltaO-18 of
precipitation (deltaO-18ppt) is reduced on average
by 10 parts per thousand and sea surface salinity
(SSS) along the western coast is reduced up to 11
parts per thousand. Calibration of the coral
deltaO-18 from Secas Island against instrumental sea
surface temperature (SST), SSS, precipitation and
deltaO-18(ppt) data indicate that seasonal rainfall
induced variations in seawater deltaO-18 are
responsible for approximately 80{\%} of the annual
deltaO-18 variance. Past El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) events are recorded as minor 0.2
to 0.4 parts per thousand deltaO-18 changes
superimposed on the dominant annual
deltaO-18seawater and salinity variations. The
annual cycle in coral deltaO-18 (average 0.9 parts
per thousand) accounts for the largest component of
variance at 51{\%} and is the direct result of the
annual northward expansion of the eastern Pacific
ITCZ. The regularity of the reconstructed seasonal
ITCZ cycle indicates that over the length of the
record the zone of maximum rainfall in the eastern
Pacific has always expanded north to at least Panama
in every northern hemisphere summer. Significant
interannual and interdecadal deltaO-18 oscillations
occur at average periods near 9, 3-7 (ENSO band), 17
and 33 years (listed in order of decreasing
variance). Over the past 20 years similar decadal
shifts are apparent in coral deltaO-18 from
nearshore in the Gulf of Panama. SST data spanning
the last 40 years show no decadal changes. This
indicates that decadal oscillations in the Gulf of
Chiriqui deltaO-18 record are regional features not
related to SST changes, but are caused by ITCZ
precipitation effects on the deltaO-18 of
seawater. A 9-year period in Panama precipitation
supports this conclusion and provides a potential
link between interannual coral deltaO-18 variations
and ITCZ precipitation. It is also shown that the
period of the average 9-year interannual period in
coral deltaO-18 varies from approximately 7.5 years
to approximately 11.8 years. Variance near 11 years
is strongest throughout the 1800s, however, a poor
direct correlation with sunspot number and solar
irradiance leaves the origin of this interannual
oscillation in question. The deltaO-18 time series
also contains a long-term trend of -0.40 parts per
thousand suggesting an increase in precipitation
and/or SST since the early 1800s. As the Gulf of
Chiriqui coral deltaO-18 time series is the first
paleoclimatic record of past variations in the ITCZ,
other seasonal-resolution reconstructions of the
past behavior of the ITCZ are required to test
whether the interannual and long-term variability
observed in the eastern Pacific ITCZ is more than
regional in scale.},

abstract = {We discuss 3D global simulations of the early martian climate that we have performed assuming a faint young Sun and denser CO2 atmosphere. We include a self-consistent representation of the water cycle, with atmosphere–surface interactions, atmospheric transport, and the radiative effects of CO2 and H2O gas and clouds taken into account. We find that for atmospheric pressures greater than a fraction of a bar, the adiabatic cooling effect causes temperatures in the southern highland valley network regions to fall significantly below the global average. Long-term climate evolution simulations indicate that in these circumstances, water ice is transported to the highlands from low-lying regions for a wide range of orbital obliquities, regardless of the extent of the Tharsis bulge. In addition, an extended water ice cap forms on the southern pole, approximately corresponding to the location of the Noachian/Hesperian era Dorsa Argentea Formation. Even for a multiple-bar CO2 atmosphere, conditions are too cold to allow long-term surface liquid water. Limited melting occurs on warm summer days in some locations, but only for surface albedo and thermal inertia conditions that may be unrealistic for water ice. Nonetheless, meteorite impacts and volcanism could potentially cause intense episodic melting under such conditions. Because ice migration to higher altitudes is a robust mechanism for recharging highland water sources after such events, we suggest that this globally sub-zero, ‘icy highlands' scenario for the late Noachian climate may be sufficient to explain most of the fluvial geology without the need to invoke additional long-term warming mechanisms or an early warm, wet Mars.},

height to 300 hPa, drops to zero about 100 hPa at
the tropopause, and has reverse sign to 30 hPa with
peak negative values at 70 hPa. Spatially at low
levels it shows warmth throughout most of the
Tropics although with weak or slightly opposite sign
in the western tropical Pacific and a strong
reversed sign in the Pacific subtropics. Coherent
wave structures below 700 hPa at higher latitudes
cancel out in the zonal mean. However, the structure
becomes more zonal above about 700 hPa and features
off-equatorial maxima straddling the equator in the
eastern Pacific in the upper troposphere with
opposite sign at 100 hPa, as a signature of a forced
Rossby wave. The corresponding sea level pressure
pattern is similar to but more focused in equatorial
regions than the Southern Oscillation pattern. The
time series highlights the 1997/98 El Nino along
with those in 1982/83 and 1986/87, and the 1988/89
La Nina, and correlates strongly with global mean
surface temperatures. Missing, however, is the
prolonged sequence of three successive El Nino
events in the early 1990s, which are highlighted in
EOF-3 as part of a mainly lower-frequency decadal
variation that features modest zonal mean warming
below 700 hPa, cooling from 700 to 300 hPa, and
warming above 300 hPa, peaking at 100 hPa and
extending from 40 degrees N to 50 degrees
S. Spatially at the surface this pattern is
dominated by Southern Oscillation wave-1 structures
throughout the Tropics and especially the
subtropics. The regional temperature structures are
coherent throughout the troposphere, with strongest
values in the Pacific and extending well into the
extratropics, with a sign reversal at and above 100
hPa. Strong Rossby wave signatures are featured in
the troposphere with a distinctive quadrupole
pattern that reverses at 100 hPa. The vertical
coherence of all patterns suggests that they should
be apparent in broad-layer satellite temperature
records but that stratospheric anomalies are not
independent. The quite different three-dimensional
structure of these different patterns highlights the
need to consider the full structure outside of the
Pacific and at all vertical levels in accounting for
impacts of ENSO, and how they relate to the global
mean.},

simulate the response of the El Ni (n) over
tildeo-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system to solar
and orbital forcing over the Holocene. Solar forcing
is reconstructed from radiocarbon production rate
data, using various scaling factors to account for
the conflicting estimates of solar irradiance
variability. As estimates of the difference since
the Maunder Minimum range from 0.05{\%} to 0.5{\%} of the
solar "constant,'' we consider these two extreme
scenarios, along with the intermediate case of
0.2{\%}. We show that for large or moderate forcings,
the low-pass-filtered east-west sea surface
temperature gradient along the equator responds
almost linearly to irradiance forcing, with a short
phase lag (about a decade). Wavelet analysis shows a
statistically significant enhancement of the
century-to-millennial-scale ENSO variability for
even a moderate irradiance forcing. In contrast, the
0.05{\%} case displays no such enhancement. Orbitally
driven insolation forcing is found to produce a
long-term increase of ENSO variability from the
early Holocene onward, in accordance with previous
findings. When both forcings are combined, the
superposition is approximately linear in the strong
scaling case. Overall, the sea surface temperature
response is of the magnitude required, and is
persistent enough, to induce important climatic
perturbations worldwide. The results suggest that
ENSO may plausibly have acted as a mediator between
the Sun and the Earth's climate. A comparison to key
Holocene climate records, from the Northern
Hemisphere subtropics and midlatitudes, shows
support for this hypothesis.},

the precipitation P and evaporation E, and the
moisture transport and divergence in the atmosphere
from the global atmospheric National Centers for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-NCAR reanalyses
produced with four-dimensional-data
assimilation. The moisture fields are summarized by
the precipitable water which is compared with
analyzed fields from NVAP based primarily on Special
Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) over the oceans and
rawinsonde measurements over land, plus TIROS
Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). The moisture
budgets are evaluated through computation of the
freshwater flux at the surface E - P from the
divergence of the total moisture transport, and this
is compared with the reanalysis E - P that is based
upon a 6-hour integration of the assimilating model
and thus depends on the model parametrizations. The
P field is evaluated using Xie-Arkin global
precipitation estimates which, although containing
considerable uncertainties, are believed to be
reliable and good enough to show that there are
substantial biases in the NCEP P. There are many
fields of interest and which are improved over
previous information available. On an annual mean
basis the largest evaporation of over 6 mm/day is in
the subtropical Indian Ocean. However, the NCEP
moisture fields are shown to contain large and
significant biases in the tropics. The tropical
structures are less well defined and values are
generally smaller where they should be high and
higher where they should be low. In addition, the
NCEP moisture fields contain less variability from
year to year. The NCEP model P generally reveals a
double intertropical convergence zone in the central
Pacific and the location of the South Pacific
Convergence Zone is not well captured. Rainfall
amounts are lower than observed in the oceanic
tropical convergence zones. The variability in the
central tropical Pacific of P associated with El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is underestimated
in the NCEP reanalyses and, moreover, is not very
well correlated with the Xie-Arkin product. A bias
for too much rainfall in the model over the
southeastern USA and southeast Asia is also present
in northern summer. The comparison of E - P from the
moisture budget with the model results reveal some
strong systematic differences. In particular,
remarkably, many island stations show up as
bull's-eyes in the difference held. These are
identified as originating from small but systematic
differences in vertical moisture profiles from those
in the surrounding oceans, raising questions about
the influence radius of rawinsonde moisture
observations. Biases in E are inferred from the E -
P differences in some places implying some spurious
land moisture sources. While usually better, the
residual method E - P estimates are inferior to
those from the model parametrizations in some
places. Both estimates are affected by biases in
moisture, as analyzed, and the moisture divergence
depends critically on the velocity divergence
held. The model estimates also depend upon the
parametrizations of subgrid scale processes, such as
convection, that influence E and P. A discussion is
given of sources of errors contributing to the
moisture budgets.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Sea ice volume has decreased in the last decades, evoked by changes in sea ice area and thickness. Estimates of sea ice area and thickness rely on a number of geophysical parameters which introduce large uncertainties. To quantify these uncertainties we use freeboard retrievals from ICESat and investigate different assumptions about snow depth, sea ice density and area. We find that uncertainties in ice area are of minor importance for the estimates of sea ice volume during the cold season in the Arctic basin. The choice of mean ice density used when converting sea ice freeboard into thickness mainly influences the resulting mean sea ice thickness, while snow depth on top of the ice is the main driver for the year-to-year variability, particularly in late winter. The absolute uncertainty in the mean sea ice thickness is 0.28 m in February/March and 0.21 m in October/November. The uncertainty in snow depth contributes up to 70{\%} of the total uncertainty and the ice density 30–35{\%}, with higher values in October/November. We find large uncertainties in the total sea ice volume and trend.

abstract = {The analysis of the interannual variability of the
South American monsoon rainfall is carried out
separately for austral spring and summer (and for
November and January), based on a 40-yr station
gauge dataset. Relationships between modes of
variability in these seasons show the influence of
antecedent conditions in spring (or November) on the
evolution of the monsoon rainfall in peak summer (or
January). In spring the first mode is dipolelike,
with opposite loadings over central-eastern and
southeastern South America. It is connected with
ENSO. The second mode shows the highest loadings
slightly south of the South Atlantic convergence
zone. The leading mode of summer also features
dipolelike oscillations between central-eastern and
southeastern South America, but is not strongly
connected with ENSO. The second mode represents the
impact of ENSO, and the third is modulated by SST
anomalies in the southern tropical Atlantic.
Significant relationships are disclosed between the
first dipolelike modes of spring and summer rainfall
and thus between the rainfall in spring and summer
over central-eastern South America, which includes
part of the monsoon core region. These dipolelike
modes are associated with a rotational anomaly over
southeast Brazil that either conveys moisture flux
into central-eastern Brazil (if it is cyclonic) or
into southeastern South America (if it is
anticyclonic). In spring this anomaly seems to be
remotely forced, but after strong rainfall anomalies
over central-eastern Brazil in spring, it tends to
reverse sign in peak summer, inverting the
dipolelike rainfall anomalies. This reversal is
hypothesized to be locally forced by
surface-atmosphere feedback triggered by the spring
anomalies, as weaker teleconnections in summer allow
local processes that are stronger in summer to
overcome remote forcing. SST and circulation
anomalies associated with the first modes in spring
and summer, and also the relationship between the
first summer mode and surface temperature in spring,
are consistent with that hypothesis.},

VARIABILITY: IMPLICATIONS FOR PREDICTION Given that
over the course of the next 10-30 years the
magnitude of natural decalial variations may rival
that of anthropogenically forced climate change on
regional scales, it is envisioned that initialized
decadal predictions will provide important
information for climate-related management and
adaptation decisions. Such predictions are presently
one of the grand challenges for the climate
community. This requires identifying those physical
phenomena and their model equivalents that May
provide additional predictability on decadal time
scales, including an assessment of the physical
processes through which anthropogenic forcing may
interact with or project upon natural
variability. Such a physical framework is necessary
to provide a consistent assessment (and insight into
potential improvement) of the decadal prediction

validated lilac-honeysuckle "spring index" model to
reconstruct a more complete record of first leaf

examined mid-bloom dates for apple (Malus domestica)

linear trends for FLD or FFD versus year had
negative slopes (advanced development). Regression
analysis of pooled data for the 72 sites indicated
an advance of - 0.092 day/year for FFD (P=
0.003). The slope for FLD was also negative (- 0.048
day/year), but not significant (P= 0.234). The
simulated data from the "spring index" model, which
relies on local daily temperature records, indicated
highly significant (P{\textless} 0.001) negative slopes of -

an advance in spring phenology ranging from 2 to 8

abstract = {A wide range of hydrological cycles and general
circulations was simulated with an idealized general
circulation model (GCM) by varying the optical
thickness of the longwave absorber. While the
idealized GCM does not capture the full complexity
of the hydrological cycle, the wide range of
climates simulated allows the systematic development
and testing of theories of how precipitation and
moisture transport change as the climate
changes. The simulations show that the character of
the response of the hydrological cycle to variations
in longwave optical thickness differs in different
climate regimes. The global-mean precipitation
increases linearly with surface temperature for
colder climates, but it asymptotically approaches a
maximum at higher surface temperatures. The basic
features of the precipitation-temperature relation,
including the rate of increase in the linear regime,
are reproduced in radiative-convective equilibrium
simulations. Energy constraints partially account
for the precipitation-temperature relation but are
not quantitatively accurate. Large-scale
condensation is most important in the midlatitude
storm tracks, and its behavior is accounted for
using a stochastic model of moisture advection and
condensation. The precipitation associated with
large-scale condensation does not scale with mean
specific humidity, partly because the condensation
region moves upward and meridionally as the climate
warms, and partly because the mean condensation rate
depends on isentropic specific humidity gradients,
which do not scale with the specific humidity
itself. The local water vapor budget relates local
precipitation to evaporation and meridional moisture
fluxes, whose scaling in the subtropics and
extratropics is examined. A delicate balance between
opposing changes in evaporation and moisture flux
divergence holds in the subtropical dry zones. The
extratropical precipitation maximum follows the
storm track in warm climates but lies equatorward of
the storm track in cold climates.},

The spatial pattern indicates that the thinning was a strong function of ice thickness, with the greatest thinning occurring where the ice was initially thickest. A similar relationship between sea ice thinning and the initial thickness is reproduced individually by three global climate models in response to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the models' atmosphere. All three models have weak trends in their surface winds and one model lacks ice dynamics altogether, implying that trends in the atmosphere or ice circulation are not necessary to produce a relatively high rate of thinning over the central Arctic or a thickness change that increases with the initial thickness. A general theory is developed to describe the thinning of sea ice subjected to climate perturbations, and it is found that the leading component of the thickness depende...},

largest increases observed in the fall. In this
study, we apply the multitaper method with singular
value decomposition (MTM-SVD) multivariate spectral
analysis to characterize the space-time variability
of fall precipitation over the United States from
1895 to 2004. MTM-SVD analysis of precipitation
demonstrates the presence of statistically
significant secular and decadal signals. The decadal
signal in fall precipitation, with a period of
approximately 12 years, is large and spatially
correlated across most of the central United
States. The secular signal, with a period greater
than 55 years, is weaker, much less spatially
correlated and is strongest in the eastern United
States. The decadal and secular variations increased
in magnitude after 1950, the period when many
previous studies have identified large linear
trends. Linear trends in fall precipitation are
found to be more spatially consistent with the
pattern of decadal variations than the secular
variations, suggesting that increasing decadal
variations in precipitation after 1950 have
contributed to large linear trends reported by
several previous studies. Our results suggest that
the strong spatial correlation in decadal
precipitation variations across the central United
States are associated with a large SLP gradient
across North America that is conducive for southerly
flow from the Gulf of Mexico. Secular variations in
SLP associated with precipitation over the United
States are located primarily in the high latitudes,

@article{ault10,
abstract = {The authors use singular spectrum analysis to
investigate the relative magnitude of decadal to
multidecadal (D2M) variability in annual and
seasonal precipitation anomalies across North
America. In most places, decadal (10-20 yr) or
multidecadal (20-50 yr) variability makes up less
than 10{\%} of the total variance in either annual or
seasonal precipitation, with interannual variability
or secular trends having much greater
importance. Decadal variability is most prominent
(contributing 25{\%}-30{\%} of the total variance) in
Minnesota and northern California during winter, and
the central Rocky Mountains in autumn. Eastern
Quebec is the only major region where precipitation
exhibits significant variance in the multidecadal
band. Precipitation across much of Canada exhibits
significant variance at extremely low frequencies
(greater than 50 yr), but variability at these time
scales cannot be separated from secular trends
because of the limited length of instrumental
climate records. Decadal signals in the discharge of
the Sacramento River and, to a lesser degree, the
Colorado River are coherent and in phase with
similar signals in regional precipitation.
Prominent D2M signals do not resemble the
low-frequency components of major climate modes such
as ENSO or the PDO, which suggests that this
behavior is not a product of a simple linear
translation of a single climate forcing.},

@article{schwartz99_surface_phenology,
abstract = {The objective of this work was to document the
utility of phenological data derived from satellite
sensors by comparing them with modelled
phenology. Surface phenological model outputs (first
leaf and first bloom dates) were correlated
positively with satellite sensor-derived start of
season (SOS) dates for 1991-1995 across the eastern
United States. The correlation was highest for
forest (r approximate to 0.62 for deciduous trees
and 0.64 for mixed woodland) and tall grass (r
approximate to 0.46) and lowest for short grass (r
approximate to 0.37). The average correlation over
all land cover types was 0.61. Average SOS dates
were consistently earlier than Spring Index dates
across all land cover types. This finding and
limited native tree phenology data suggest that the
SOS technique detects understorey green-up in the
forest rather than overstorey species. The biweekly
temporal resolution of the satellite sensor data
placed an upper limit on prediction accuracy; thus,
year-to-year variations at individual sites were
typically small. Nevertheless, the correct biweek
SOS could be identified from the surface models 61{\%}
of the time, and fl biweek 96{\%} of the time. Further
temporal refinement of the satellite sensor
measurements is necessary in order to connect them
with surface phenology adequately and to develop
links among 'green wave' components in selected
biomes.},

@article{cai10,
abstract = {An asymmetry, and its multidecadal variability, in a
rainfall teleconnection with the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) are described. Further, the
breakdown of this relationship since 1980 is offered
as a cause for a rainfall reduction in an
ENSO-affected region, southeast Queensland
(SEQ). There, austral summer rainfall has been
declining since around the 1980s, but the associated
process is not understood. It is demonstrated that
the rainfall reduction is not simulated by the
majority of current climate models forced with
anthropogenic forcing factors. Examination shows
that ENSO is a rainfall-generating mechanism for the
region because of an asymmetry in its impact: the La
Nina-rainfall relationship is statistically
significant, as SEQ summer rainfall increases with
La Nina amplitude; by contrast, the El Nino-induced
rainfall reductions do not have a statistically
significant relationship with El Nino
amplitude. Since 1980, this asymmetry no longer
operates, and La Nina events no longer induce a
rainfall increase, leading to the observed SEQ
rainfall reduction. A similar asymmetric rainfall
teleconnection with ENSO Modoki exists and shares
the same temporal evolutions. This breakdown is
caused by an eastward shift in the Walker
circulation and the convection center near
Australia's east coast, in association with a
post-1980 positive phase of the interdecadal Pacific
oscillation (IPO). Such a breakdown occurred before
1950, indicating that multidecadal variability alone
could potentially be responsible for the recent SEQ
rainfall decline. An aggregation of outputs from
climate models to distill the impact of climate
change suggests that the asymmetry and the breakdown
may not be generated by climate change, although
most models do not perform well in simulating the
ENSO-rainfall teleconnection over the SEQ region.},

abstract = {The glaciers of western Canada and the conterminous
United States have dominantly retreated since the
end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the nineteenth
century, although average rates of retreat varied
from strong in the first-half of the twentieth
century, with glaciers stabilizing or even advancing
until 1980, and then resuming consistent
recession. This retreat has been accompanied by
statistically detectable declines in late-summer
streamflow from glacier-fed catchments over much of
the Study area, although there is some geographical
variation: over recent decades, glaciers in
northwest BC and southwest Yukon have lost mass
dominantly by thinning with relatively low rates of
terminal retreat, and glacier-fed streams in that
region have experienced increasing flows. In many
valleys, glacier retreat has produced geomorphic
hazards, including outburst floods from
moraine-dammed lakes, mass failures from
oversteepened valley walls and debris flows
generated on moraines. In addition to these
hydrologic and geomorphic changes, evidence is
presented that glacier retreat will result in higher
stream temperatures, possibly transient increases in
suspended sediment fluxes and concentrations, and
changes in water chemistry. With climate projected
to continue warming over the twenty-first century,
current trends in hydrology, geomorphology and water
quality should continue, with a range of
implications for water resources availability and
management and hydroecology, particularly for cool
and cold-water species such as salmonids. Copyright

abstract = {One of the few long instrumental records available for the Arctic is the Svalbard Airport composite series that hitherto began in 1911, with observations made on Spitsbergen, the largest island in the Svalbard Archipelago. This record has now been extended to 1898 with the inclusion of observations made by hunting and scientific expeditions. Temperature has been observed almost continuously in Svalbard since 1898, although at different sites. It has therefore been possible to create one composite series for Svalbard Airport covering the period 1898–2012, and this valuable new record is presented here. The series reveals large temperature variability on Spitsbergen, with the early 20th century warming as one striking feature: an abrupt change from the cold 1910s to the local maxima of the 1930s and 1950s. With the inclusion of the new data it is possible to show that the 1910s were colder than the years at the start of the series.

abstract = {Mechanisms for El Nino-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO)-like decadal (7-35 years) variability are
analyzed using observational data. When a decadal
positive temperature anomaly occurs in the eastern
tropical Pacific, the atmospheric response excites
negative wind stress curl in the western tropical
South Pacific, which causes the thermocline to shoal
and induce a negative temperature anomaly there. The
cold anomaly moves northwestward to the western and
central equatorial region and then turns eastward
along the equator to reverse the original
temperature anomaly in the east. The eastward
propagation of the oceanic signal along the
equatorial thermocline correlates with a zonal wind
anomaly. The cold anomaly in the east grows through
tropical air-sea interaction and induces a positive
wind stress curl, in the western tropical South
Pacific associated with the atmospheric
teleconnection in the Southern
Hemisphere. Subsequent evolution of the negative
phase is similar to that of the positive phase. The
complete scenario for this ENSO-like decadal
variability due to the air-sea interaction processes
within the tropics has a period of similar to 14
years. We also discuss ENSO-like variation on the
interdecadal ({\textgreater} 35 years) timescale, with possible

relationships between plant phenology and
satellite-sensor-derived measures of greenness, and
to advance a new procedure for determining the
growing season of land vegetation at the regional
scale. Three phenological stations were selected as
sample sites to represent different climatic zones
and vegetation types in northern China. The mixed
data set consists of occurrence dates of all
observed phenophases for 50-70 kinds of trees and
shrubs from 1983 to 1988. Using these data, we
calculated the cumulative frequency of phenophases
in every 5-day period (pentad) throughout each year,
and also drew the cumulative frequency distribution
curve for all station-years, in order to reveal the
typical seasonal characteristics of these plant
communities. The growing season was set as the time
interval between 5{\%} and 95{\%} of the phenological
cumulative frequency. Average lengths of the growing
season varied between 188 days in the northern, to
259 days in the southern part of the research
region. The beginning and end dates of the surface
growing season were then applied each year as time
thresholds, to determine the corresponding 10-day
peak greenness values from normalized difference
vegetation index curves for 8-km(2) pixels overlying
the phenological stations. Our results show that, at
the beginning of the growing season, the largest
average greenness value occurs in the southern part,
then in the northern, and finally the middle part of
the research region. In contrast, at the end of the
growing season, the largest average greenness value
is measured in the northern part, next in the middle
and lastly the southern part of the research
region. In future studies, these derived NDVI
thresholds can be applied to determine the growing
season of similar plant communities at other sites,
which lack surface phenological data.},

characteristics and their application as
paleoclimate archives. Cave sediments can be
separated into two broad categories, elastic

most useful as climatic records. Techniques for
dating cave sediments include radiocarbon and U/Th
dating of speleothems and paleomagnetic reversals

sediments. Cosmogenic isotope dating of elastic
sediments in caves with multiple levels or which
occur at different elevations provide a geomorphic
record of cave ages and river system evolution over
the past 5 Ma. Isotope profiles, trace element
profiles, color banding and luminescence profiles of
speleothems, mainly stalagmites, produce a detailed
paleoclimate record with very high time resolution
over the past several hundred thousand years. There
is potential application of these methods to late
Holocene climates with implications for evaluation
of current concern over global warming.},

The dipole anomaly corresponds to the second-leading mode of EOF of monthly mean sea level pressure (SLP) north of 70°N during the winter season (October–March) and accounts for 13{\%} of the variance. One of its two anomalous centers is stably occupied between the Kara Sea and Laptev Sea; the other is situated from the Canadian Archipelago through Greenland extending southeastward to the Nordic seas. The dipole anomaly differs from one described in other papers that can be attributed to an eastward shift of the center of action of the North Atlantic Oscillation.

abstract = {The authors exploit the remarkable similarity
between recent climate trends and the structure of
the "annular modes" in the month-to-month
variability (as described in a companion paper) to
partition the trends into components linearly
congruent with and linearly independent of the
annular modes. The index of the Northern Hemisphere
(NH) annular mode, referred to as the Arctic
Oscillation (AO), has exhibited a trend toward the
high index polarity over the past few decades. The
largest and most significant trends are observed
during the "active season" for stratospheric
planetary wave-mean flow interaction, January-March
(JFM), when fluctuations in the AO amplify with
height into the lower stratosphere. For the periods
of record considered, virtually all of the JFM
geopotential height falls over the polar cap region
and the strengthening of the subpolar westerlies
from the surface to the lower stratosphere, similar
to 50{\%} of the JFM warming over the Eurasian
continent, similar to 30{\%} of the JFM warming over
the NH as a whole, similar to 40{\%} of the JFM
stratospheric cooling over the polar cap region, and
similar to 40{\%} of the March total column ozone
losses poleward of 40 degrees N are linearly
congruent with month-to-month variations in the AO
index. Summertime sea level pressure falls over the
Arctic basin are suggestive of a year-round drift
toward the positive polarity of the AO, but the
evidence is less conclusive. Owing to the
photochemical memory inherent in the ozone
distribution, roughly half the ozone depletion
during the NH summer months is linearly dependent on
AO-related ozone lasses incurred during the previous
active season. Lower-tropospheric geopotential
height falls over the Antarctic polar cap region are
indicative of a drift toward the high index polarity
of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode with no
apparent seasonality. In contrast, the trend toward
a cooling and strengthening of the SH stratospheric
polar vortex peaks sharply during the stratosphere's
relatively short active season centered in
November. The most pronounced SE ozone losses have
occurred in September-October, one or two months
prior to this active season. In both hemispheres,
positive feedbacks involving ozone destruction,
cooling, and a weakening of the wave-driven
meridional circulation may be contributing to a
delayed breakdown of the polar vortex and enhanced
ozone losses during spring.},

This conjecture is central to a hypothesis in which Arctic sea ice loss forms the beginning link of a causal chain that includes weaker westerlies in midlatitudes, more persistent and amplified midlatitude waves, and more extreme weather. Through model experimentation, the first step in this chain is examined by quantifying contributions of various physical factors to October–December (OND) mean Arctic tropospheric warming since 1979. The results indicate that the main factors responsible for Arctic tropospheric warming are recent decadal fluctuations and long-term changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs), both located outside the Arctic.

clear seasonal variations with mean seasonal

corresponds with seasonal variations in solar
radiation. The seasonal amplitude of
delta(18)O(coral) variations are small
(0.23-0.57parts per thousand), but they are
significantly correlated with sea surface
temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS). The
delta(18)O(coral) and SST are more strongly
correlated during El Ni (n) over tildeo/Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) warm phases (r=-0.8l,p{\textless}0.01) than
during non-ENSO phases (r=-0.65,p{\textless}0.01) and ENSO
cool phases (r=-0.48,p{\textless}0.01). These different
relationships are due to differences in winter SST
and in seawater delta(18)O (delta(18)O(sw)) during
ENSO warm phases ({\textless}27 degreesC and higher values of
delta(18)O(sw)) compared with cool phases ({\textgreater}28
degreesC and lower values of delta(18)O(sw)) at

from movements of the Western Pacific Warm Pool

ENSO. Anomalies in delta(18)O(sw), inferred from the
delta(18)O(coral) and instrumental SST, are
consistent with SSS anomalies for the years
1980-2000. These delta(18)O(sw) anomalies may
reflect changes in SSS and evaporation-precipitation
due to movements of the WTNNIP. This detailed

It is found that the use of data averaged over periods longer than the inherent time-scale of the involved variables can result in a dramatic weakening of the detected nonlinearity.

have a prominent zonally symmetric
component. Observations of global Precipitation
variability and the moisture budget within
atmospheric reanalyses are examined to argue that
the zonally symmetric component is caused by
interactions between transient eddies and tropical
ly-forced changes in the subtropical jets. During El
Niho events the jets strengthen in each hemisphere
and shift equatorward. Changes in the subtropical
jet influence the transient-eddy momentum fluxes and
the eddy-driven mean meridional circulation. During
El Nino events, eddy-driven ascent in the
midlatitudes of each hemisphere is accompanied by
low-level convergence and brings increased
precipitation. These changes in the transient-eddy
and stationary-eddy moisture fluxes almost exactly
cancel each other and, in Ann, do not contribute to
the zonal-mean precipitation anomalies. Propagation
of anomalous stationary waves disrupts the zonal
symmetry. Flow around the deeper Aleutian Low and
the eastward extension of the Pacific jet stream
supply the moisture for increased precipitation over
the eastern North Pacific and the Western seaboard
of the United States. while transient-eddy moisture
convergence supplies the moisture for increased
precipitation over the southern United States. In
each case, increased precipitation is fundamentally
caused by anomalous ascent forced by anomalous heat
and vorticity fluxes.},

shows clear footprints of interaction between
atmospheric circulation and orography. The unique
features of this diverse climate regime challenges
climate modeling. This paper provides detailed
analyses of observations and regional climate
simulations to improve our understanding and
modeling of the climate of this region. The primary
data used in this study are the 1/8degrees gridded
temperature and precipitation based on station
observations and the NCEP - NCAR global
reanalyses. These data were used to evaluate a 20-yr
regional climate simulation performed using the
fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University -
National Center for Atmospheric Research (Penn State
- NCAR) Mesoscale Model (MM5) driven by large-scale
conditions of the NCEP - NCAR reanalyses. Regional
climate features examined include seasonal mean and
extreme precipitation; distribution of precipitation
rates; and precipitation intensity, frequency, and
seasonality. The relationships between precipitation
and surface temperature are also analyzed as a means
to evaluate how well regional climate simulations
can be used to simulate surface hydrology, and
relationships between precipitation and elevation
are analyzed as diagnostics of the impacts of
surface topography and spatial resolution. The
latter was performed at five east - west transects
that cut across various topographic features in the
western United States. These analyses suggest that
the regional simulation realistically captures many
regional climate features. The simulated seasonal
mean and extreme precipitation are comparable to
observations. The regional simulation produces
precipitation over a wide range of precipitation
rates comparable to observations. Obvious biases in
the simulation include the oversimulation of
precipitation in the basins and intermountain West
during the cold season, and the undersimulation in
the Southwest in the warm season. There is a
tendency of reduced precipitation frequency rather
than intensity in the simulation during the summer
in the Northwest and Southwest, which leads to the
insufficient summer mean precipitation in those
areas. Because of the general warm biases in the
simulation, there is also a tendency for more
precipitation events to be associated with warmer
temperatures, which can affect the simulation of
snowpack and runoff.},

abstract = {Continuous, high-resolution delta(18)O records from
cored sediments of Pyramid Lake, Nevada, indicate
that oscillations in the hydrologic balance
occurred, on average, about every 150 years (yr)
during the past 7630 calendar years (cal yr). The
records are not stationary; during the past 2740 yr,
drought durations ranged from 20 to 100 yr and
intervals between droughts ranged from 80 to 230
yr. Comparison of tree-ring-based reconstructions of
climate change for the past 1200 yr from the Sierra
Nevada and the El Malpais region of northwest New
Mexico indicates that severe droughts associated
with Anasazi withdrawal from Chaco Canyon at 820 cal
yr BP (calendar years before present) and final
abandonment of Chaco Canyon, Mesa Verde, and the
Kayenta area at 650 cal yr BP may have impacted much
of the western United States. During the middle
Holocene (informally defined in this paper as
extending from 8000 to 3000 cal yr BP), magnetic
susceptibility values of sediments deposited in
Pyramid Lake's deep basin were much larger than
late-Holocene (3000-0 cal yr BP) values, indicating
the presence of a shallow take. In addition, the
mean delta(18)O value of CaCO3 precipitated between
6500 and 3430 cal yr BP was 1.6parts per thousand
less than the mean value of CaCO3 precipitated after
2740 cal yr BP. Numerical calculations indicate that
the shift in the delta(18)O baseline probably
resulted from a transition to a wetter ({\textgreater} 30{\%}) and
cooler (3-5degreesC) climate. The existence of a
relatively dry and warm middle-Holocene climate in
the Truckee River-Pyramid Lake system is generally
consistent with archeological, sedimentological,
chemical, physical, and biological records from
various sites within the Great Basin of the western
United States. Two high-resolution Holocene-climate
records are now available from the Pyramid and Owens
lake basins which suggest that the Holocene was
characterized by five climatic intervals. TIC and
6180 records from Owens Lake indicate that the first
interval in the early Holocene (11,600 10,000 cal yr
BP) was characterized by a drying trend that was
interrupted by a brief (200 yr) wet oscillation
centered at 10,300 cal yr BP. This was followed by a
second early-Holocene interval (10,000-8000 cal yr
BP) during which relatively wet conditions
prevailed. During the early part of the middle
Holocene (8000-6500 cal yr BP), high-amplitude
oscillations in TIC in Owens Lake and delta(18)O in
Pyramid Lake indicate the presence of shallow lakes
in bomb basins. During the latter part of the middle
Holocene (6500 3800 cal yr BP), drought conditions
dominated, Owens Lake desiccated, and Lake Tahoe
ceased spilling to the Truckee River, causing
Pyramid Lake to decline. At the beginning of the
late Holocene (similar to 3000 cal yr BP), Lake
Tahoe rose to its sill level and Pyramid Lake
increased in volume. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Marine records suggest that the amplitude of climate variability was smaller before that time, but such records are often poorly resolved. Moreover, it is not possible to infer the abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from marine records. Here we report the recovery of a deep ice core from Dome C, Antarctica, that provides a climate record for the past 740,000 years. For the four most recent glacial cycles, the data agree well with the record from Vostok. The earlier period, between 740,000 and 430,000 years ago, was characterized by less pronounced warmth in interglacial periods in Antarctica, but a higher proportion of each cycle was spent in the warm mode. The transition from glacial to interglacial conditions about 430,000 years ago (Termination V) resembles the transition into the present interglacial period in terms of the magnitude of change in temperatures and greenhouse gases, but there are significant differences in the patterns of change. The interglacial stage following Termination V was exceptionally long--28,000 years compared to, for example, the 12,000 years recorded so far in the present interglacial period. Given the similarities between this earlier warm period and today, our results may imply that without human intervention, a climate similar to the present one would extend well into the future.},

general circulation model (GCM) provides a promising
means to study isotopic variability in
precipitation, including the processes that cause
isotopic variability in paleoclimatic archives such
as ice cores. This paper describes the
implementation and validation of stable isotope
tracers in the GENESIS 2.0 GCM. The model reproduces
the main features of present-day isotopic fields and
the characteristic large-scale isotope-climate
relationships. Global delta(18)O-deltaD,
temperature-delta(18)O, and precipitation-delta(18)O
relationships are well simulated, and the modeled
regional patterns associated with continental vapor
recycling over Europe and vertical gradients agree
well with observations. In GENESIS a more
sophisticated parameterization of interactions
between precipitation and atmospheric vapor
contributes to a better simulation of isotopic
variations in dry climates. The standard model
underestimates the global mean deuterium excess
(deltaD-8delta(18)O) in precipitation, although a
heuristic sensitivity test suggests this may be
remedied by accounting for nonneutral stratification
in isotopic evaporative fractionation over
ocean. Errors in simulated isotopic fields are
analyzed to determine whether they are caused by
local climatic biases in the GCM or by inaccurate
parameterizations of isotope physics. Using the
results of sensitivity experiments and comparisons
with other isotopic GCM results, we identify key
isotopic and climatic processes at the origin of the
main errors and suggest additional studies to
improve isotope simulations.},

pattern of Pacific climate variability, and by
others as a blend of two sometimes independent modes

of North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST)
variability. A growing body of evidence highlights a
strong tendency for PDO impacts in the Southern
Hemisphere, with important surface climate anomalies
over the mid-latitude South Pacific Ocean, Australia
and South America. Several independent studies find
evidence for just two full PDO cycles in the past
century: "cool" PDO regimes prevailed from 1890-1924
and again from 1947-1976, while "warm" PDO regimes
dominated from 1925-1946 and from 1977 through (at
least) the mid-1990's. Interdecadal changes in
Pacific climate have widespread impacts on natural
systems, including water resources in the Americas
and many marine fisheries in the North
Pacific. Tree-ring and Pacific coral based climate
reconstructions suggest that PDO variations-at a
range of varying time scales-can be traced back to
at least 1600, although there are important
differences between different proxy
reconstructions. While 20th Century PDO fluctuations

from 15-to-25 years, and the other from 50-to-70

abstract = {During the early Pliocene, 5 to 3 million years ago,
globally averaged temperatures were substantially
higher than they are today, even though the external
factors that determine climate were essentially the
same. In the tropics, El Nino was continual (or
"permanent'') rather than intermittent. The
appearance of northern continental glaciers, and of
cold surface waters in oceanic upwelling zones in
low latitudes (both coastal and equatorial),
signaled the termination of those warm climate
conditions and the end of permanent El Nino. This
led to the amplification of obliquity (but not
precession) cycles in equatorial sea surface
temperatures and in global ice volume, with the
former leading the latter by several thousand
years. A possible explanation is that the gradual
shoaling of the oceanic thermocline reached a
threshold around 3 million years ago, when the winds
started bringing cold waters to the surface in low
latitudes. This introduced feedbacks involving
ocean-atmosphere interactions that, along with
ice-albedo feedbacks, amplified obliquity cycles. A
future melting of glaciers, changes in the
hydrological cycle, and a deepening of the
thermocline could restore the warm conditions of the
early Pliocene.},

mode (NAM) is shown to be significantly different

action of the annular mode is more prominent and
extends deeper into Siberia, its related surface air
temperature signal is stronger, and the compensating
outer ring in the sea-level pressure field is much
broader, encompassing the entire tropics. During
cold winters the NAM signature is much more
pronounced over the Pacific sector: the sea-level
pressure pattern exhibits a North Pacific center of
action, positively correlated with the Atlantic
center, and pronounced deflections of the storm
track are also evident. It is suggested that the
former features are associated with the equatorward
displacement of the jet stream and the storm tracks
during warm winters of the ENSO cycle and the latter
is related to the the more pronounced break in the
subtropical jet stream over the Pacific sector
during cold winters.},

abstract = {High- resolution speleothem records from China have
provided insights into the factors that control the
strength of the East Asian monsoon(1-4). Our
understanding of these factors remains incomplete,
however, owing to gaps in the record of monsoon
history over the past two interglacial - glacial
cycles. In particular, missing sections have
hampered our ability to test ideas about orbital-
scale controls on the monsoon(5-7), the causes of
millennial- scale events(8,9) and relationships
between changes in the monsoon and climate in other
regions. Here we present an absolute- dated oxygen
isotope record from Sanbao cave, central China, that
completes a Chinese-cave-based record of the
strength of the East Asian monsoon that covers the
past 224,000 years. The record is dominated by
23,000-year- long cycles that are synchronous within
dating errors with summer insolation at 65 degrees N
(ref. 10), supporting the idea that tropical/
subtropical monsoons respond dominantly and directly
to changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation
on orbital timescales(5). The cycles are punctuated
by millennial- scale strong-summer-monsoon events
(Chinese interstadials(1)), and the new record
allows us to identify the complete series of these
events over the past two interglacial - glacial
cycles. Their duration decreases and their frequency
increases during glacial build- up in both the last
and penultimate glacial periods, indicating that ice
sheet size affects their character and pacing. The
ages of the events are exceptionally well
constrained and may thus serve as benchmarks for
correlating and calibrating climate records.},

ENSO events. The recent multidecadal increase in the
number of CP events relative to EP events, which has
been hypothesized to be connected to anthropogenic
change in the state of the ocean, is also found to
be consistent with multivariate red noise and hence
with stationary statistics. ENSO "flavors" are the
consequence of differing combinations of two
initially orthogonal spatial patterns that are
precursors to CP or EP events of both signs. These
precursors can be excited by random weather forcing
and subsequently result in SST anomaly amplification

Rather than evaluating the absolute errors of nonprobabilistic temperature and precipitation forecasts, as is common in other contests, this contest evaluated the skill of specifying probabilities for precipitation amounts and temperature intervals. To forecast optimally for the contest, both accurate forecasts and accurate determination of one's uncertainty about the outcome were necessary. The contest results indicated that forecasters over a range of education levels produced skillful forecasts of temperature and precipitation relative to persistence and climatology. However, in this contest forecasters were not successful in assessing the uncertainty of their maximum or minimum temperatures from day to day, as measured by the correlation of interval width and absolute error.

abstract = {Future intensification of Amazon drought resulting from climate change may cause increased fire activity, tree mortality, and emissions of carbon to the atmosphere across large areas of Amazonia. To provide a basis for addressing these issues, we examine properties of recent and future meteorological droughts in the Amazon in 35 climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). We find that the CMIP5 climate models, as a group, simulate important properties of historical meteorological droughts in the Amazon. In addition, this group of models reproduces observed relationships between Amazon precipitation and regional sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific and the North Atlantic oceans. Assuming the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario for future drivers of climate change, the models project increases in the frequency and geographic extent of meteorological drought in the eastern Amazon, and the opposite in the West. For the region as a whole, the CMIP5 models suggest that the area affected by mild and severe meteorological drought will nearly double and triple, respectively, by 2100. Extremes of wetness are also projected to increase after 2040. Specifically, the frequency of periods of unusual wetness and the area affected by unusual wetness are projected to increase after 2040 in the Amazon as a whole, including in locations where annual mean precipitation is projected to decrease. Our analyses suggest that continued emissions of greenhouse gases will increase the likelihood of extreme events that have been shown to alter and degrade Amazonian forests.},

When the anticyclones are best developed, during local summer, subsidence and equatorward advection on the eastern flanks of the anticyclones cool SSTs, while poleward flow on the western flanks warms SSTs. During local winter the SST asymmetry across the subtropical North Atlantic and North Pacific is maintained by warm water advection in the western boundary currents that offsets the large extraction of heat by advection of cold, dry air of the continents and by transient eddies. In the Southern Hemisphere ocean processes are equally important in cooling the eastern oceans by upwelling and advection during local winter.

abstract = {Western United States forest wildfire activity is widely thought to have increased in recent decades, yet neither the extent of recent changes nor the degree to which climate may be driving regional changes in wildfire has been systematically documented. Much of the public and scientific discussion of changes in western United States wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19th- and 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a comprehensive database of large wildfires in western United States forests since 1970 and compared it with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. Here, we show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons. The greatest increases occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests, where land-use histories have relatively little effect on fire risks and are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.},

instrumental record is too short to discern
centennial-scale trends and modelling results are
inconclusive(1-5). Proxy reconstructions indicate
that ENSO activity was relatively high during the
late twentieth century(6-10), but whether this was
unusual in the millennial context remains
uncertain. Here we present insight's into these
issues derived from rings of the kauri tree (Agathis
australis), a rare long-lived conifer endemic to the
forests of northern New Zealand. Our results
indicate that the twentieth century was the most
'ENSO-active' century of the past 500 years, but may
not be unique in the context of the past 700 years,
and that ENSO activity comparable to or elevated
above that experienced during the late twentieth
century is plausible under warmer-than-present
conditions. We also find evidence that there may
have been significant changes in the ENSO
teleconnection to the New Zealand region during the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and of
multi-decadal fluctuations in ENSO-related activity
building up to the present day. Although these two
features may delay the expression of increased ENSO
activity in the New Zealand region, our results
indicate that New Zealand climate is likely to be
more dominated by ENSO-related inter-annual
variability as the world continues to warm.},

abstract = {Over the past decade the southern catchments of the
Murray Darling Basin (MDB), responsible for much of
Australia's agricultural output, have experienced a
severe drought (termed the "Big Dry'') with record
high temperatures and record low inflow. We find
that during the Big Dry the sensitivity of soil
moisture to rainfall decline is over 80{\%} higher
than during the World War II drought from
1937-1945. A relationship exists between soil
moisture and temperature independent of rainfall,
particularly in austral spring and summer. Annually,
a rise of 1 degrees C leads to a 9{\%} reduction in
soil moisture over the southern MDB, contributing to
the recent high sensitivity. Since 1950, the impact
from rising temperature contributes to 45{\%} of the
total soil moisture reduction. In a warming climate,
as the same process also leads to an inflow
reduction, the reduced water availability can only
be mitigated by increased rainfall. Other
implications for future climate change are
discussed. Citation: Cai, W., T. Cowan, P. Briggs,

Nutrients fuel the growth of phytoplankton, the base of a very productive coastal marine ecosystem [Pauly D, Christensen V (1995) Nature 374:255-257]. Because nutrient supply and phytoplankton biomass in shelf waters are highly sensitive to variation in upwelling-driven circulation, shifts in the timing and strength of upwelling may alter basic nutrient and carbon fluxes through marine food webs. We show how a 1-month delay in the 2005 spring transition to upwelling-favorable wind stress in the northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem resulted in numerous anomalies: warm water, low nutrient levels, low primary productivity, and an unprecedented low recruitment of rocky intertidal organisms. The delay was associated with 20- to 40-day wind oscillations accompanying a southward shift of the jet stream. Early in the upwelling season (May-July) off Oregon, the cumulative upwelling-favorable wind stress was the lowest in 20 years, nearshore surface waters averaged 2 degrees C warmer than normal, surf-zone chlorophyll-a and nutrients were 50{\%} and 30{\%} less than normal, respectively, and densities of recruits of mussels and barnacles were reduced by 83{\%} and 66{\%}, respectively. Delayed early-season upwelling and stronger late-season upwelling are consistent with predictions of the influence of global warming on coastal upwelling regions.},

These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountain top species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level.},

A way forward is through further investigation of atmospheric dynamic mechanisms. During several exceptionally warm Arctic winters since 2007, sea ice loss in the Barents and Kara Seas initiated eastward-propagating wave trains of high and low pressure. Anomalous high pressure east of the Ural Mountains advected Arctic air over central and eastern Asia, resulting in persistent cold spells. Blocking near Greenland related to low-level temperature anomalies led to northerly flow into eastern North America, inducing persistent cold periods. Potential Arctic connections in Europe are less clear. Variability in the North Pacific can reinforce downstream Arctic changes, and Arctic amplification...},

precipitation data were regionally averaged from
five weather stations well distributed across the
state. The averaged earlywood chronology accounted
for 56{\%} of the variance in instrumental November -
March precipitation 1942 - 1983. We validated the
reconstruction against independent precipitation
records. The worst winter drought of the 20th
century in Durango occurred 1950 - 1965. However,
the reconstruction indicates droughts more severe
than any witnessed in the 20th century, e. g., the
1850s - 1860s, and the megadrought in the mid- to
late-16th century. Reconstructed winter
precipitation 1540 - 1579 shows 33 of 40 years were

Nina episodes. The Tropical Rainfall Index (TRI)
correlates well with instrumental and reconstructed
winter precipitation (r = 0.49 and 0.55,
respectively), reflecting the strong ENSO modulation
of cool season climate over northern Mexico. The
ENSO teleconnection varies through time, with

sites were used to develop a proxy record of annual
(June to June) precipitation spanning the 1226 to
2001 AD interval for the Uinta Basin Watershed of
northeastern Utah. The reconstruction reveals
significant precipitation variability at interannual
to decadal scales. Single-year dry events before the
instrumental period tended to be more severe than
those after 1900. In general, decadal scale dry
events were longer and more severe prior to 1900. In
particular, dry events in the late 13th, 16th, and
18th Centuries surpass the magnitude and duration of
droughts seen in the Uinta Basin after 1900. The
last four decades of the 20th Century also represent
one of the wettest periods in the

instrumental record (approximately 1900 to the
Present) underestimates the potential frequency and
severity of severe, sustained droughts in this area,
while over representing the prominence of wet
episodes. In the longer record, the empirical
probability of any decadal scale drought exceeding
the duration of the 1954 through 1964 drought is 94
percent, while the probability for any wet event

abstract = {Seasonal climate anomalies over North America
exhibit rather large variability between years
characterized by the same ENSO phase. This lack of
consistency reduces potential statistically based
ENSO-related climate predictability. The authors
show that the North Pacific oscillation (NPO) exerts
a modulating effect on ENSO teleconnections. Sea
lever pressure (SLP) data over the North Pacific,
North America, and the North Atlantic and daily
rainfall records in the contiguous United States are
used to demonstrate that typical ENSO signals tend
to be stronger and more stable during preferred
phases of the NPO. Typical El Nino patterns (e.g.,
low pressure over the northeastern Pacific, dry
northwest, and wet southwest, etc.) are strong and
consistent only during the high phase of the NPO,
which is associated with an anomalously cold
northwestern Pacific. The generally reversed SLP and
precipitation patterns during La Nina winters are
consistent only during the low NPO phase. Climatic
anomalies tend to be weak and spatially incoherent
during low NPO-El Nino and high NPO-La Nina
winters. These results suggest that confidence in
ENSO-based long-range climate forecasts for North
America should reflect interdecadal climatic
anomalies in the North Pacific.},

abstract = {A horizontal core 2.8 m in length drilled from the
Georgia Giant column in Carlsbad Cavern provides
climate information for the last 164 ka. Forty-six
alpha spectrometric U-series ages determined at
intervals of similar to 7.6 cm along the core
indicate five periods of deposition and five
hiatuses, the longest from 136 to 110 ka. Variations
in growth rate (0 to 70 mm/ka), in the abundance of
aragonite, chalcedony, and Fe-bearing phases, and in
C-13 indicate that glacial intervals of the last 164
ka, OIS 6, 4, and 2, were much wetter than today, as
were the colder substages 5d and 5b of OIS 5. By
contrast, during the two warmest periods of the past
164 ka, namely OIS 5e and 1, there was no deposition
on either side of the speleothem, suggesting
conditions as dry or drier than today. The record
from Carlsbad parallels data from many other sites
in the southwestern USA and northern Mexico, and
data from marine sediments and ice cores,
demonstrating the extent to which ice sheet
fluctuations influenced conditions in southern New
Mexico. Detailed correlation of delta C-13 values in
the Georgia Giant, which range from -6.6 to +0.9
parts per thousand relative to PDB, with distant
speleothem records and with data from ice cores,
further documents the linkage of southwestern
climate with global-scale extent of glaciation.
Values of delta O-18 in the Georgia Giant core range
from -9.7 to -4.7 parts per thousand relative to PDB
and average -6.6 parts per thousand. O-18-depleted
carbonate in the Georgia Giant during OIS 6, at a
time when the world's oceans were enriched in O-18,
suggests that precipitation during cold intervals
was brought largely by Pacific air masses in fall,
winter and spring as a result of the southward
displacement of the polar jet stream by the growth
of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Termination II,
marking the end of the penultimate glaciation, is
well defined in the core's delta O-18
data. Analytical uncertainties in the radiometric
ages do not preclude a start of Termination 11 as
late as 128 ka, as suggested by SPECMAP
data. However, data from the Georgia Giant core are
more compatible with an earlier start like that
obtained from Devils Hole and Vostok data, raising
the possibility that early warming was widespread in
the U.S. southwest region by 145 ka. (c) 2006

We show, however, that this basin has not warmed uniformly: Although the tropics and subtropics have warmed, the subpolar ocean has cooled. These regional differences require local surface heat flux changes (+/-4 watts per square meter) much larger than the basinwide average. Model investigations show that these regional differences can be explained by large-scale, decadal variability in wind and buoyancy forcing as measured by the North Atlantic Oscillation index. Whether the overall heat gain is due to anthropogenic warming is difficult to confirm because strong natural variability in this ocean basin is potentially masking such input at the present time.},

has recently been developed and released to the
climate community. CCSM3 is a coupled climate model
with components representing the atmosphere, ocean,
sea ice, and land surface connected by a flux
coupler. CCSM3 is designed to produce realistic
simulations over a wide range of spatial
resolutions, enabling inexpensive simulations
lasting several millennia or detailed studies of
continental-scale dynamics, variability, and climate
change. This paper will show results from the
configuration used for climate-change simulations
with a T85 grid for the atmosphere and land and a
grid with approximately 1 degrees resolution for the
ocean and sea ice. The new system incorporates
several significant improvements in the physical
parameterizations. The enhancements in the model
physics are designed to reduce or eliminate several
systematic biases in the mean climate produced by
previous editions of CCSM. These include new
treatments of cloud processes, aerosol radiative
forcing, land-atmosphere fluxes, ocean mixed layer
processes, and sea ice dynamics. There are
significant improvements in the sea ice thickness,
polar radiation budgets, tropical sea surface
temperatures, and cloud radiative effects. CCSM3 can
produce stable climate simulations of millennial
duration without ad hoc adjustments to the fluxes
exchanged among the component models. Nonetheless,
there are still systematic biases in the
ocean-atmosphere fluxes in coastal regions west of
continents, the spectrum of ENSO variability, the
spatial distribution of precipitation in the
tropical oceans, and continental precipitation and
surface air temperatures. Work is under way to
extend CCSM to a more accurate and comprehensive

abstract = {A 3000-year varve-thickness record from Hv{\'{i}}t{\'{a}}rvatn, a glacier-dominated lake in central Iceland, preserves inter-annual variations in the delivery of glacially eroded sediment to the lake. The first-order low-frequency trend in varve thickness reflects increased glacial erosion through the Late Holocene, reaching a peak during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Superimposed on this trend are large inter-annual to decadal fluctuations in varve thickness that we suggest reflect variability in climate parameters that determine the efficiency of the fluvial transport system to deliver glacially eroded sediment to the lake each year. We use spectral analysis to test whether regular high-frequency cyclicity in varve thickness exists in the 3-ka record after removing the low-frequency variability. Spectral analyses from three sediment cores recovered from the lake show essentially the same periods of 2.8–3.4, 13, 35–40 and 85–93, for the overlapping ∼900-year period. Additionally, cycles of 55, 130 and 290 years are found in the spectrum for the 3000-year record that do not show up in the spectra for the shorter cores. Some of these cycles show similar variability to those of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). This relationship is supported by a significant correlation between varve thickness and both the NAO (precipitation) and AMO (summer temperature) indices over the 180-year instrumental period. NAO cyclicities (2–15 years) are weakly expressed in the first half of the record, increase between 600 and 1000 AD, decrease in strength during medieval time, and are most strongly expressed between 1300 AD and the early 20th century. AMO cyclicities (50 to 130 years) are also relatively weak in the first half of the record, becoming quite strong between 600 and 1000 AD and again between 1100 and 1500 AD, but are essentially absent through the peak of the LIA, between 1500 and 1900 AD, a time when strong cyclicities of about 35 years appear.},

1950-99. Geographical regions, latitude bands, and
elevation classes where these trends are
statistically significantly different from trends

runoff as a fraction of water-year accumulated
runoff. Observed changes were compared to natural
internal climate variability simulated by an 850-yr
control run of the finite volume version of the
Community Climate System Model, version 3
(CCSM3-FV), statistically downscaled to a
(1)/(8)degrees grid using the method of constructed
analogs. Both observed and downscaled model
temperature and precipitation data were then used to
drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC)
hydrological model to obtain the hydrological
variables analyzed in this study. Large trends
(magnitudes found less than 5{\%} of the time in the
long control run) are common in the observations and
occupy a substantial part (37{\%}-42{\%}) of the
mountainous western United States. These trends are
strongly related to the large-scale warming that
appears over 89{\%} of the domain. The strongest
changes in the hydrologic variables, unlikely to be
associated with natural variability alone, have
occurred at medium elevations $\backslash$$\backslash${\{}[{\$}\backslashbackslash{\$}$\backslash${\}}750-2500 m for JFM
runoff fractions and 500-3000 m for
SWE/Precip(ONDJFM)] where warming has pushed
temperatures from slightly below to slightly above
freezing. Further analysis using the data on
selected catchments indicates that hydroclimatic
variables must have changed significantly (at 95{\%}
confidence level) over at least 45{\%} of the total
catchment area to achieve a detectable trend in
measures accumulated to the catchment scale.},

abstract = {The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the
dominant mode of interannual climate variability on
Earth, alternating between anomalously warm (El
Nino) and cold (La Nina) conditions in the tropical
Pacific at intervals of 2-8 years(1,2). The
amplitude of ENSO variability affects the occurrence
and predictability of climate extremes around the
world(3,4), but our ability to detect and predict
changes in ENSO amplitude is limited by the fact
that the instrumental record is too short to
characterize its natural variability(5-8). Here we
use the North American Drought Atlas(9,10)-a
database of drought reconstructions based on
tree-ring records-to produce a continuous, annually
resolved record of ENSO variability over the past
1,100 years. Our record is in broad agreement with
independent, ENSO-sensitive proxy records in the
Pacific and surrounding regions. Together, these
records indicate that ENSO amplitude exhibits a
quasi-regular cycle of 50-90 years that is closely
coupled to the tropical Pacific mean
state. Anomalously warm conditions in the eastern
Pacific are associated with enhanced ENSO
variability, consistent with model
simulations(11). The quasi-periodic ENSO amplitude
modulation reported here offers a key observational
constraint for improving models and their prediction
of ENSO behaviour linked to global warming.},

abstract = {Higher temperatures increase the moisture-holding
capacity of the atmosphere and can lead to greater
atmospheric demand for evapotranspiration,
especially during warmer seasons of the year.
Increases in precipitation or atmospheric humidity
ameliorate this enhanced demand, whereas decreases
exacerbate it. In the southwestern United States
(Southwest), this means the greatest changes in
evapotranspirational demand resulting from higher
temperatures could occur during the hot-dry
foresummer and hot-wet monsoon. Here seasonal
differences in surface climate observations are
examined to determine how temperature and moisture
conditions affected evapotranspirational demand
during the pronounced Southwest droughts of the
1950s and 2000s, the latter likely influenced by
warmer temperatures now attributed mostly to the
buildup of greenhouse gases. In the hot-dry
foresummer during the 2000s drought, much of the
Southwest experienced significantly warmer
temperatures that largely drove greater
evapotranspirational demand. Lower atmospheric
humidity at this time of year over parts of the
region also allowed evapotranspirational demand to
increase. Significantly warmer temperatures in the
hot-wet monsoon during the more recent drought also
primarily drove greater evapotranspirational demand,
but only for parts of the region outside of the core
North American monsoon area. Had atmospheric
humidity during the more recent drought been as low
as during the 1950s drought in the core North
American monsoon area at this time of year, greater
evapotranspirational demand during the 2000s drought
could have been more spatially extensive. With
projections of future climate indicating continued
warming in the region, evapotranspirational demand
during the hot-dry and hot-wet seasons possibly will
be more severe in future droughts and result in more
extreme conditions in the Southwest, a
disproportionate amount negatively impacting
society.},

carried out on the assumption that the historical
record of rainfall, evaporation, streamflow, and

this does not adequately address the potential risks

climate varies markedly due to natural cycles that
operate over periods of several years to several
decades. There is also serious concern about how
anthropogenic climate change may exacerbate drought
risk in the future. In this paper, the frequency and
severity of droughts are analyzed during a range of
"climate states'' (e.g., different phases of the
Pacific, Indian, and/or Southern Oceans) to
demonstrate that drought risk varies markedly over
interannual through to multidecadal time
scales. Importantly, by accounting for climate
variability and change on multitemporal scales
(e.g., interdecadal, multidecadal, and the palaeo

of current drought management practices may be
better assessed and more robust climate adaptation

analyses of local atmospheric temperature from
hundreds of stations and ice core records have been
carried out from time scales of 10(-2) to 10(6)

as follows: (I) from 40 ka to 1 Ma a flat spectrum
is observed; (2) from 2 ka to 40 ka the spectrum is
proportional to f(-2) where f is the frequency; and
(3) below time scales of 2 ka the power spectrum is
proportional to f(-1/2). At time scales less than 1
month we observe that the power spectra of
continental stations become proportional to f(-3/2)
while maritime stations continue to have power
spectra proportional to f(-1/2) down to time scales
of 1 day. To explain these observations, we model
the vertical transport of heat in the atmosphere as
a stochastic diffusion process. The power spectrum
of temperature fluctuations at the earth's surface
expected from this model equation in a two-layer
geometry with thermal and eddy diffusion properties
appropriate to the atmosphere and the ocean and a
radiation condition at the top of the atmosphere
agrees with the observed spectrum. The difference in
power spectra between continental and marine
stations can be understood with this approach as a
consequence of the air mass above a maritime station
exchanging heat with both the atmosphere above and
the ocean below while a continental station
exchanges heat mostly with the atmosphere above. (C)

abstract = {Simulations of the climatic response to mid-Holocene
(6 ka BP) orbital forcing with two coupled
ocean-atmosphere models (FOAM and CSM) show
enhancement of monsoonal precipitation in parts of
the American Southwest. Central America and
northernmost South America during Northern
Hemisphere summer. The enhanced onshore flow that
brings precipitation into Central America is caused
by a northward displacement of the inter-tropical
convergence zone, driven by cooling of the
equatorial and warming of the northern subtropical
and mid-latitude ocean. Ocean feedbacks also enhance
precipitation over the American Southwest, although
the increase in monsoon precipitation there is
largely driven by increases in land-surface
temperature. The northward shift in the equatorial
precipitation band that causes enhanced
precipitation in Central America and the American
Southwest has a negative feedback effect on
monsoonal precipitation in northern South
America. The simulations demonstrate that
mid-Holocene aridity in the mid-continent of North
America is dynamically linked to the orbitally
induced enhancement of the summer monsoon in the
American Southwest, with a spatial structure (wet in
the Southwest and dry in the mid-continent) similar
to that found in strong monsoon years today. Changes
in winter precipitation along the west coast of
North America, in Central America and along the Gulf
Coast, caused by southward-displacement of the
westerly storm tracks, indicate that changes in the
Northern Hemisphere winter monsoon also play a role
in regional climate changes during the
mid-Holocene. Although the simulations with FOAM and
CSM differ in detail, the general mechanisms and
patterns are common to both. The model results thus
provide a coherent dynamical explanation for
regional patterns of increased or decreased aridity
shown by vegetation, lake status and aeolian data
from the Americas.},

abstract = {The Bosumtwi impact crater in Ghana, arguably the
best-preserved complex young impact structure known
on Earth, displays a pronounced rim and is almost
completely filled by Lake Bosumtwi, a hydrologically
closed basin. It is the source crater of the Ivory
Coast tektites. The structure was excavated in
2.1-2.2 Gyr old metasediments and metavolcanics of
the Birimian Supergroup. A drilling project was
conceived that would combine two major scientific
interests in this crater: 1) to obtain a complete
paleoenvironmental record from the time of crater
formation about one million years ago, at a
near-equatorial location in Africa for which very
few data are available so far, and 2) to obtain a
complete record of impactites at the central uplift
and in the crater moat, for ground truthing and
comparison with other structures. Within the
framework of an international and multidisciplinary
drilling project led by the International
Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP), 16
drill cores were obtained from June to October 2004
at six locations within Lake Bosumtwi, which is 8.5
kin in diameter. The 14 sediment cores are currently
being investigated for paleoenvironmental
indicators. The two impactite cores LB-07A and
LB-08A were drilled into the deepest section of the
annular moat (540 in) and the flank of the central
uplift (450 in), respectively. They are the main
subject of this special issue of Meteoritics {\&}
Planetary Science, which represents the first
detailed presentations of results from the deep
drilling into the Bosumtwi impactite
sequence. Drilling progressed in both cases through
the impact breccia, layer into fractured
bedrock. LB-07A comprises lithic (in the uppermost
part) and suevitic impact breccias with appreciable
amounts of impact melt fragments. The lithic clast
content is dominated by graywacke, besides various
metapelites, quartzite, and a carbonate target
component. Shock deformation in the form of quartz
grains with planar microdeformations is
abundant. First chemical results indicate a number
of suevite samples that are strongly enriched in
siderophile elements and Mg, but the presence of a
definite meteoritic component in these samples
cannot be confirmed due to high indigenous
values. Core LB-08A comprises suevitic breccia in
the uppermost part, followed with depth by a thick
sequence of graywacke-dominated metasediment with
suevite and a few granitoid dike intercalations. It
is assumed that the metasediment package represents
bedrock intersected in the flank of the central
uplift. Both 7A and 8A suevite intersections differ
from suevites outside of the northern crater rim.
Deep drilling results confirmed the gross structure
of the crater as imaged by the pre-drilling seismic
surveys. Borehole geophysical studies conducted in
the two boreholes confirmed the low seismic
velocities for the post-impact sediments (less than
1800 m/s) and the impactites (2600-3300 m/s). The
impactites exhibit very high porosities (up to 30
vol{\%}), which has important implications for
mechanical rock stability. The statistical analysis
of the velocities and densities reveals a
seismically transparent impactite sequence (free of
prominent internal reflections). Petrophysical core
analyses provide no support for the presence of a
homogeneous magnetic unit (= melt breccia) within
the center of the structure. Borehole vector
magnetic data point to a patchy distribution of
highly magnetic rocks within the impactite sequence.
The lack of a coherent melt sheet, or indeed of any
significant amounts of melt rock in the crater fill,
is in contrast to expectations from modeling and
pre-drilling geophysics, and presents an interesting
problem for comparative studies and requires
re-evaluation of existing data from other
terrestrial impact craters, as well as modeling
parameters.},

out variability on longer and shorter time
scales. The suggestion in their conclusions that
ENSO may be a major contributor to recent trends in

Comparison of the CryoSat-2/AltiKa retrieved snow depth with in situ measurements provided by Operation IceBridge shows a good agreement with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5cm. Analysis of the CryoSat-2/AltiKa retrieved snow depths over three winters (2013–2015) reveals a thinner snow cover on both Multi-Year (32{\%}–57{\%}) and First-Year Ice (63{\%}–75{\%}) relative to the 1954–91 Warren climatology, suggesting the need for more contemporary year-round and basin-scale snow depth fields.},

abstract = {The fifth-generation Pennsylvania State
University-NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5)-based regional
climate model (CMM5) capability in simulating the
interannual variations of U. S. precipitation and
surface air temperature during 1982-2002 is
evaluated with a continuous baseline integration
driven by the NCEP Department of Energy (DOE) Second
Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project Reanalysis
(R-2). It is demonstrated that the CMM5 has a
pronounced downscaling skill for precipitation and
temperature interannual variations. The EOF and
correlation analyses illustrate that, for both
quantities, the CMM5 captures the spatial pattern,
temporal evolution, and circulation teleconnections
much better than the R-2. In particular, the CMM5
more realistically simulates the precipitation
pattern centered in the Northwest, where the
representation of the orographic enhancement by the
forced uplifting during winter (rainy season) is
greatly improved over the R-2. The downscaling
skill, however, is sensitive to the cumulus
parameterization. This sensitivity is studied by
comparing the baseline with a branch summer
integration replacing the Grell with the
Kain-Fritsch cumulus scheme in the CMM5. The
dominant EOF mode of the U. S. summer precipitation
interannual variation, identified with the
out-of-phase relationship between the Midwest and
Southeast in observations, is reproduced more
accurately by the Grell than the Kain-Fritsch
scheme, which largely underestimates the variation
in the Midwest. This pattern is associated with
east-west movement of the Great Plains low-level jet
(LLJ): a more western position corresponds to a
stronger southerly flow bringing more moisture and
heavier rainfall in the Midwest and less in the
Southeast. The second EOF pattern, which describes
the consistent variation over the southern part of
the Midwest and the South in observations, is
captured better by the Kain-Fritsch scheme than the
Grell, whose pattern systematically shifts
southward.},

abstract = {Over the past half century, the Arctic has warmed at about twice the global rate. The reduction of sea ice and snow cover has contributed to the high-latitude warming, as the maximum of the amplification during autumn is a fingerprint of the ice-albedo feedback. There is evidence that atmospheric water vapor, a greenhouse gas, has increased in the Arctic over the past several decades. Ocean heat fluxes into the Arctic from the North Atlantic and North Pacific have also contributed to the Arctic warming through a reduction of sea ice. Observational and modeling studies suggest that reduced sea ice cover and a warmer Arctic in autumn may affect the middle latitudes by weakening the west-to-east wind speeds in the upper atmosphere, by increasing the frequency of wintertime blocking events that in turn lead to persistence or slower propagation of anomalous temperatures in middle latitudes, and by increasing continental snow cover that can in turn influence the atmospheric circulation. While these effects on middle latitudes have been suggested by some analyses, natural variability has thus far precluded a conclusive demonstration of an impact of the Arctic on mid-latitude weather and climate.},

interdecadal SST regime shifts greater than 0.75
degreesC. Comparison with decadal climate
variability in the North Pacific, as represented by
the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (1900-1997),
indicates that several of the largest decadal-scale

with the Southern Oscillation are given based upon

abstract = {A key feature of anticipated 21st century droughts
in Southwest North America is the concurrence of
elevated temperatures and increased
aridity. Instrumental records and paleoclimatic
evidence for past prolonged drought in the Southwest
that coincide with elevated temperatures can be
assessed to provide insights on temperature-drought
relations and to develop worst-case scenarios for
the future. In particular, during the medieval
period, similar to AD 900-1300, the Northern
Hemisphere experienced temperatures warmer than all
but the most recent decades. Paleoclimatic and model
data indicate increased temperatures in western
North America of approximately 1 degrees C over the
long-term mean. This was a period of extensive and
persistent aridity over western North
America. Paleoclimatic evidence suggests drought in
the mid-12th century far exceeded the severity,
duration, and extent of subsequent droughts. The
driest decade of this drought was anomalously warm,
though not as warm as the late 20th and early 21st
centuries. The convergence of prolonged warming and
arid conditions suggests the mid-12th century may
serve as a conservative analogue for severe droughts
that might occur in the future. The severity,
extent, and persistence of the 12th century drought
that occurred under natural climate variability,
have important implications for water resource
management. The causes of past and future drought
will not be identical but warm droughts, inferred
from paleoclimatic records, demonstrate the
plausibility of extensive, severe droughts, provide
a long-term perspective on the ongoing drought
conditions in the Southwest, and suggest the need
for regional sustainability planning for the
future.},

abstract = {The role of leading modes of Indo-Pacific climate
variability is investigated for modulation of the
strength of the Indian summer monsoon during the
period 1877-2006. In particular, the effect of
Indian Ocean conditions on the relationship between
the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the
Indian monsoon is explored. Using an extended
classification for ENSO and Indian Ocean dipole
(IOD) events for the past 130 years and reanalyses,
we have expanded previous interannual work to show
that variations in Indian Ocean conditions modulate
the ENSO-Indian monsoon relationship also on decadal
timescales. El Nino events are frequently
accompanied by a significantly reduced Indian
monsoon and widespread drought conditions due to
anomalous subsidence associated with a shift in the
descending branch of the zonal Walker
circulation. However, for El Nino events that
co-occur with positive IOD (pIOD) events, Indian
Ocean conditions act to counter El Nino's
drought-inducing subsidence by enhancing moisture
convergence over the Indian subcontinent, with an
average monsoon season resulting. Decadal
modulations of the frequency of independent and
combined El Nino and pIOD events are consistent with
a strengthened El Nino-Indian monsoon relationship
observed at the start of the 20th century and the
apparent recent weakening of the El Nino-Indian

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

abstract = {The midlatitude response to tropical Pacific SST
anomalies involves changes in transient eddy
propagation, but the processes leading to the
transient eddy changes are still not clear. In a
recent study, we used a series of controlled general
circulation model (GCM) experiments in which an
imposed tropical Pacific sea-surface temperature
(SST) anomaly is turned on abruptly and the response
is analyzed in terms of its high-and low-frequency
parts, to show that the changes in transient eddies
induced by El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) arise
from changes in wave refraction on the altered mean
flow. In this work, we use a quasi-geostrophic
linear model and a linear stationary wave model, to
interpret the GCM experiments and obtain the
sequence of events that lead from a tropical SST
anomaly to the quasi-equilibrium change in the mean
and transient atmospheric circulation. The initial
direct response of the mean flow is confined to the
tropical and subtropical Pacific, similar to what is
obtained from a stationary wave model. This
tropical-subtropical mean flow change initiates a
transient eddy response, which induces a midlatitude
mean flow anomaly. The wave-mean flow system evolves
towards a state in which the eddy anomalies maintain
the mean flow anomalies, allowing them to
persist. It is further shown that, while eddy
momentum fluxes persistently accelerate and
decelerate the subtropical and midlatitude mean
flow, the eddy heat flux effect on the zonal mean
flow is much more variable, and only marginally
significant. The linear quasi-geostrophic model
calculations capture the evolution of eddy momentum
flux anomalies equatorwards of 60 degrees N quite
well, suggesting linear wave refraction can explain
the midlatitude ENSO anomalies. However, other
processes, like stationary waves or changes in the
nonlinear stage of eddy life cycles, are needed to
explain the ENSO-related anomalies at high
latitudes, polewards of around 60 degrees

abstract = {Twenty ice cores drilled in medium to high accumulation areas of the Greenland ice sheet have been used to extract seasonally resolved stable isotope records. Relationships between the seasonal stable isotope data and Greenland and Icelandic temperatures as well as atmospheric flow are investigated for the past 150--200 years. The winter season stable isotope data are found to be influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and very closely related to {\{}SW{\}} Greenland temperatures. The linear correlation between the first principal component of the winter season stable isotope data and Greenland winter temperatures is 0.71 for seasonally resolved data and 0.83 for decadally filtered data. The summer season stable isotope data display higher correlations with Stykkisholmur summer temperatures and North Atlantic {\{}SST{\}} conditions than with {\{}SW{\}} Greenland temperatures. The linear correlation between Stykkisholmur summer temperatures and the first principal component of the summer season stable isotope data is 0.56, increasing to 0.66 for decadally filtered data. Winter season stable isotope data from ice core records that reach more than 1400 years back in time suggest that the warm period that began in the 1920s raised southern Greenland temperatures to the same level as those that prevailed during the warmest intervals of the Medieval Warm Period some 900--1300 years ago. This observation is supported by a southern Greenland ice core borehole temperature inversion. As Greenland borehole temperature inversions are found to correspond better with winter stable isotope data than with summer or annual average stable isotope data it is suggested that a strong local Greenland temperature signal can be extracted from the winter stable isotope data even on centennial to millennial time scales. },

Several pilot field experiments have been conducted so far, and the results are analyzed. The field experiments will continue through 2016. The STORM programme was originally conceived for understanding the Severe Thunderstorms known as Nor'westers that affect West Bengal and the Northeastern parts of India during the pre- monsoon season. The Nor'westers cause loss of human lives and damage to properties worth millions of Dollars annually. Since the neighbouring south Asian countries are also affected by thunderstorms, the STORM programme is expanded to cover the South Asian countries under the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). It covers all the SAARC countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) in 3 phases. Some of the science plans, viz., monitoring life cycle of Nor'westers/ severe thunderstorms, their three dimensional structure, to understand the interrelationship among dynamics, cloud microphysics and electrical properties in the thunderstorm environment are new to the severe weather research. This paper describes the general setting of the field experiment and discusses preliminary results based on the pilot field data. Typical lengths of the squall lines, 2 their intensity, and speed of movements, cloud top temperatures, and their heights are discussed based on the pilot field data. The SAARC STORM programme will complement the Severe Weather Forecast Demonstration Project (SWFDP) of WMO. It would also generate large-scale interest for fuelling research among the scientific community, and broaden the perspectives of operational meteorologists and researchers.},

pronounced moisture variability during the early

stimulated luminescence and C-14 ages from nearby
terraced aggradational alluvial deposits indicate a
paucity of large floods in the Late Pleistocene and
at least five large flood events in the last c. 6
kyr, interpreted to mark an increased frequency of
extreme rainfall events in the middle Holocene
despite overall reduced EP. Increased EP in
south-central Australia during the early to middle
Holocene resulted from (1) decreased El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability, which
reduced the frequency of El Nino-triggered droughts,
(2) the prevalence of a more La Nina-like mean
climatic state in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which
increased available atmospheric moisture, and (3) a
southward shift in the Intertropical Convergence
Zone (ICTZ), which allowed tropical summer storms
associated with the Australian summer monsoon (ASM)
to penetrate deeper into the southern part of the
continent. The onset of heightened aridity and
apparent increase in large flood frequency at c. 5
ka is interpreted to indicate the establishment of
an ENSO-like climate in arid Australia in the late
Holocene, consistent with a variety of other
terrestrial and marine proxies. The broad
synchroneity of Holocene climate change across much

time windows (1973-1995, 18631910, 1784-1809,
1688-1710). The period 1675-1760 was found to be the
coolest period of the entire record with anomalies
of 0.3-0.5 degreesC that includes the Late Maunder
Minimum (1675-1710). The warmest periods, as
indicated by our data, occur between 1880 and 1900
and the upper part of the Ifaty record (1973-1995).
We generated a time series of coral 6180 for
different seasons of the year to investigate austral
winter and summer SST variability that influences
rainfall intensity over southern Africa. Winter
coral 6180 is coherent with winter SST on decadal
and mulidecadal time scales between 1854 and
1995. We suggest that the Ifaty winter time series
provides a record of winter SST variability over the
Mozambique Channel/Agulhas Current region over 336
years. Strong Indian Ocean subtropical dipole
events, occurring during austral summer, are
displayed in the Italy record. The austral summer
coral 6180 is coherent and in phase with ENSO
indices on interannual time scales (2-4 years)
between 1880-1920, 1930-1940 and after 1970. Our
data indicate that the impact of ENSO on SW Indian
Ocean SST and atmospheric circulation was also
strong between 1680-1720 and 1760-1790, in agreement
with other studies. We show evidence that those
variations are caused by changes in the regional
hydrologic balance. The results demonstrate that the
impact of ENSO cycles in the region of the SW Indian
Ocean has changed significantly since 1970 and
relate to a warming of southwestern Indian Ocean
surface waters altering the spatial signature of
ENSO. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

century. We then analyse the potential of this newly
expanded palaeoclimate network to collectively
represent predictands (sea surface temperature, sea
level pressure, surface air temperature and

reconstructions. The key dynamical centres-of-action
of the equatorial Indo-Pacific are well captured by
the palaeoclimate network, indicating that there is
considerable reconstruction potential in this

a number of long coral records are
available. Current spatiotemporal gaps in data
coverage and regions where significant potential for
future proxy collection exists are discussed. We

resolution from a topographically closed (but
hydrologically open) lake basin was used to
reconstruct changes in lake salinity and evaporative

different proxies for inferring climatic change in
the glaciated Northern Great Plains (NGP). At Rice
Lake, North Dakota, the ostracode-Mg/Ca ratios show
good correlation with other ostracode, diatom and
aeolian proxy records from other sites in the
NGP. All of these records show significant
century-scale periodicities, which have been related
to solar variability as inferred from atmospheric
radiocarbon records. This coherent and consistent
pattern suggests that these sites record climatic
variability at regional scales. The interval of the
Mediaeval Climatic Anomaly from similar to900 to 550
cal. yr BP contains two pronounced dry
periods. During the following 'Little Ice Age', a
single period of frequent drought that peaked at
similar to300 cal. yr BP was bracketed by wet
periods before and after. In contrast, the
ostracode-Sr/Ca ratios and ostracode- and
mollusc-records from Rice Lake have different
patterns and do not correlate well with each other
or with the same proxies at other sites. This lack
of consistent pattern within a site and among
several regional sites suggests seasonal and/or
site-specific influences on these proxies. Variable
contributions of groundwater, with low delta(18)O
values because of selective recharge from snowmelt,
may have played an important role in determining the
isotopic composition of the lake. The poor
correlation of Sr/Ca with other proxies is caused by
mediation of inorganic carbonate mineralogy, owing
to active uptake of Sr in the formation of inorganic
aragonite. Thus, our sediment data along with
present-day lakewater chemistry suggest that
carbonate-delta(18)O records in the NGP cannot be
interpreted simply in terms of climate because of
significant local groundwater
influences. Ostracode-Mg/Ca ratios tend to be a
better indicator of past salinity because of the
conservative nature of Mg in oligosaline waters

The transport by these small-scale drafts is idealized as follows. Air from the subcloud layer is lifted to each level i between cloud base and the level of neutral buoyancy for undilute air. A fraction (ϵi) of the condensed water is then converted to precipitation, which falls and partially or completely evaporates in an unsaturated downdraft.

abstract = {Large changes in the hydrology of the western United

century. These include a reduction in the amount of
precipitation arriving as snow, a decline in
snowpack at low and midelevations, and a shift
toward earlier arrival of both snowmelt and the
centroid (center of mass) of streamflows. To project
future water supply reliability, it is crucial to
obtain a better understanding of the underlying
cause or causes for these changes. A regional
warming is often posited as the cause of these
changes without formal testing of different
competitive explanations for the warming. In this
study, a rigorous detection and attribution analysis
is performed to determine the causes of the late
winter/early spring changes in hydrologically
relevant temperature variables over mountain ranges
of the western United States. Natural internal
climate variability, as estimated from two long
control climate model simulations, is insufficient
to explain the rapid increase in daily minimum and
maximum temperatures, the sharp decline in frost
days, and the rise in degree-days above 0 degrees C
(a simple proxy for temperature-driven
snowmelt). These observed changes are also
inconsistent with the model-predicted responses to
variability in solar irradiance and volcanic
activity. The observations are consistent with
climate simulations that include the combined
effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and
aerosols. It is found that, for each temperature
variable considered, an anthropogenic signal is
identifiable in observational fields. The results
are robust to uncertainties in model-estimated
fingerprints and natural variability noise, to the

abstract = {The onset of spring is a critical time in
mid-latitude atmosphere-biosphere
interactions. Deciduous plants resume growth after
winter dormancy, and their activities cause land
surfaces to become more active agents in energy and
mass exchanges. The progress of spring plant
development driving these changes can be
conveniently monitored by observation of plant
life-stage (phenological) events. Thus, phenological
data can play a crucial role in understanding and
monitoring springtime vegetation and climate
dynamics, especially about potential changes over
time. Although global-scale phenological monitoring
is not yet possible, alternative strategies are
available to assess these impacts. In this paper, a
simple phenological model, driven by surface-level
daily maximum-minimum temperatures is employed as a
surrogate measure of the onset of spring in
China. Contrasting with results from similar studies
in North America and Europe, the onset of spring
plant growth in China has no apparent change over
1959-1993. However, during the same period, last
spring frost (-2.2degreesC) dates have become
markedly earlier (by 6 d), with the greatest change
occurring in the northeast portions of the
country. First autumn frost dates have also become
later (by 4 d), especially in north-central
China. Combining these 2 changes, the frost period
has decreased by 10 d over many northern regions of
the country. A shorting frost period is consistent
with decreasing diurnal temperature ranges and
day-to-day temperature differences during spring and
autumn in China, reported by previous research.},

abstract = {The National Snow and Ice Data Center's (NSIDC) Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) comprises three equal-area projections, combined with an infinite number of possible grid definitions. The EASE-Grid is based on a philosophy of digital mapping and gridding definitions developed at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The original, 25 kilometer grids were defined for data products generated by the NOAA/NASA Level 3 Passive Microwave Pathfinder Projects, which include gridded passive microwave brightness temperatures and related geophysical products derived from the brightness temperatures. However, the grids have been adopted by a number of other projects, including the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Polar Pathfinders, the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, St. Petersburg, Russia (AARI) Sea Ice data, and NSIDC's EASE-Grid versions of the Global Land Cover Classification (GLCC) data and the International Permafrost Association Permafrost and Ground Ice Map. The gridding philosophy used to implement a library of software routines is based on the assumption that a gridded data set is completely defined by two abstractions, the map projection and an overlaid lattice of grid points, often referred to as "cells." The software may be used to define all standard projections, and convert gridded data between them. However, this presentation will be restricted to an overview of the family of specific projections and grids that we have called the NSIDC EASE-Grid, or simply EASE-Grid. The discussion will include how to define a map projection and grid definition in general, and our reasons for choosing equal-area projections and a spherical Earth model for our target applications in particular. It will include some examples of applications and an intercomparison between EASE-Grid data sets.},

abstract = {Decadal time scale climate variability in the North
Pacific has implications for climate both locally
and over North America. A crucial question is the
degree to which this variability arises from coupled
ocean/atmosphere interactions over the North Pacific
that involve ocean dynamics, as opposed to either
purely thermodynamic effects of the oceanic mixed
layer integrating in situ the stochastic atmospheric
forcing, or the teleconnected response to tropical
variability. The part of the variability that is
coming from local coupled ocean/atmosphere
interactions involving ocean dynamics is potentially
predictable by an ocean/atmosphere general
circulation model (O/A GCM), and such predictions
could (depending on the achievable lead time) have
distinct societal benefits. This question is
examined using the results of fully coupled O/A
GCMs, as well as targeted numerical experiments with
stand-alone ocean and atmosphere models
individually. It is found that coupled
ocean/atmosphere interactions that involve ocean
dynamics are important to determining the strength
and frequency of a decadal-time scale peak in the
spectra of several oceanic variables in the Kuroshio
extension region off Japan. Local stochastic
atmospheric heat nux forcing, integrated by the
oceanic mixed layer into a red spectrum, provides a
noise background from which the signal must be
extracted. Although teleconnected ENSO responses
influence the North Pacific in the 2-7 years/cycle
frequency band, it is shown that some decadal-time
scale processes in the North Pacific proceed without
ENSO. Likewise, although the effects of stochastic
atmospheric forcing on ocean dynamics are
discernible, a feedback path from the ocean to the
atmosphere is suggested by the results.},

abstract = {The past decade has seen substantial advances in understanding Arctic amplification — that trends and variability in surface air temperature tend to be larger in the Arctic region than for the Northern Hemisphere or globe as a whole. We provide a synthesis of research on Arctic amplification, starting with a historical context and then addressing recent insights into processes and key impacts, based on analysis of the instrumental record, modeling studies, and paleoclimate reconstructions. Arctic amplification is now recognized as an inherent characteristic of the global climate system, with multiple intertwined causes operating on a spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. These include, but are not limited to, changes in sea ice extent that impact heat fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere, atmospheric and oceanic heat transports, cloud cover and water vapor that alter the longwave radiation flux to the surface, soot on snow and heightened black carbon aerosol concentrations. Strong warming over the Arctic Ocean during the past decade in autumn and winter, clearly associated with reduced sea ice extent, is but the most recent manifestation of the phenomenon. Indeed, periods of Arctic amplification are evident from analysis of both warm and cool periods over at least the past three million years. Arctic amplification being observed today is expected to become stronger in coming decades, invoking changes in atmospheric circulation, vegetation and the carbon cycle, with impacts both within and beyond the Arctic.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Sea ice concentration has been retrieved in polar regions with satellite microwave radiometers for over 30 years. However, the question remains as to what is an optimal sea ice concentration retrieval method for climate monitoring. This paper presents some of the key results of an extensive algorithm inter-comparison and evaluation experiment. The skills of 30 sea ice algorithms were evaluated systematically over low and high sea ice concentrations. Evaluation criteria included standard deviation relative to independent validation data, performance in the presence of thin ice and melt ponds, and sensitivity to error sources with seasonal to inter-annual variations and potential climatic trends, such as atmospheric water vapour and water-surface roughening by wind. A selection of 13 algorithms is shown in the article to demonstrate the results. Based on the findings, a hybrid approach is suggested to retrieve sea ice concentration globally for climate monitoring purposes. This approach consists of a combination of two algorithms plus dynamic tie points implementation and atmospheric correction of input brightness temperatures. The method minimizes inter-sensor calibration discrepancies and sensitivity to the mentioned error sources.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In comparison with the September sea-ice extent, the September sea-ice volume has larger spread in the historical simulation but faster convergence in the projection simulation, especially in the context of increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This indicates that the ice volume might be more sensitive to external forcings than the ice extent. Using the averaged projection of those climate models from the 30 CMIP5 models that can better reflect the ‘observed' sea-ice volume climatology and variability, it is shown that the September sea ice volume will decrease to {\~{}}3000 km3 in the early 2060s, and then level off under a medium-mitigation scenario.

distance metric to determine the dissimilarity
between fossil and modern biological
assemblages. Despite this quantitative approach,
interpretation of distance metrics is usually
qualitative and rules for selection of analogs tend
to be ad hoe. We present a statistical tool, the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which
provides a framework for identifying analogs from
distance metrics. If modern assemblages are placed
into groups (e.g., biomes), this method can (1)
evaluate the ability of different distance metrics
to distinguish among groups, (2) objectively
identify thresholds of the distance metric for
determining analogs, and (3) compute a likelihood
ratio and a Bayesian probability that a modern group
is an analog for an unknown (fossil)
assemblage. Applied to a set of 1689 modern pollen
assemblages from eastern North America classified
into eight biomes, ROC analysis confirmed that the
squared-chord distance (SCD) outperforms most other
distance metrics. The optimal threshold increased
when more dissimilar biomes were compared. The
probability of an analog vs no-analog result (a
likelihood ratio) increased sharply when SCD
decreased below the optimal threshold, indicating a
nonlinear relationship between SCD and the
probability of analog. Probabilities of analog
computed for a postglacial pollen record at

@article{mohino11_sst_impacts,
abstract = {The current consensus is that drought has developed
in the Sahel during the second half of the twentieth
century as a result of remote effects of oceanic
anomalies amplified by local land-atmosphere
interactions. This paper focuses on the impacts of
oceanic anomalies upon West African climate and
specifically aims to identify those from SST
anomalies in the Pacific/Indian Oceans during spring
and summer seasons, when they were
significant. Idealized sensitivity experiments are
performed with four atmospheric general circulation
models (AGCMs). The prescribed SST patterns used in
the AGCMs are based on the leading mode of
covariability between SST anomalies over the
Pacific/Indian Oceans and summer rainfall over West
Africa. The results show that such oceanic anomalies
in the Pacific/Indian Ocean lead to a northward
shift of an anomalous dry belt from the Gulf of
Guinea to the Sahel as the season advances. In the
Sahel, the magnitude of rainfall anomalies is
comparable to that obtained by other authors using
SST anomalies confined to the proximity of the
Atlantic Ocean. The mechanism connecting the
Pacific/Indian SST anomalies with West African
rainfall has a strong seasonal cycle. In spring (May
and June), anomalous subsidence develops over both
the Maritime Continent and the equatorial Atlantic
in response to the enhanced equatorial
heating. Precipitation increases over continental
West Africa in association with stronger zonal
convergence of moisture. In addition, precipitation
decreases over the Gulf of Guinea. During the
monsoon peak (July and August), the SST anomalies
move westward over the equatorial Pacific and the
two regions where subsidence occurred earlier in the
seasons merge over West Africa. The monsoon weakens
and rainfall decreases over the Sahel, especially in
August.},

abstract = {More than half (52{\%}) of the spatial and temporal variance in multidecadal drought frequency over the conterminous United States is attributable to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). An additional 22{\%} of the variance in drought frequency is related to a complex spatial pattern of positive and negative trends in drought occurrence possibly related to increasing Northern Hemisphere temperatures or some other unidirectional climate trend. Recent droughts with broad impacts over the conterminous U.S. (1996, 1999-2002) were associated with North Atlantic warming (positive AMO) and northeastern and tropical Pacific cooling (negative PDO). Much of the long-term predictability of drought frequency may reside in the multidecadal behavior of the North Atlantic Ocean. Should the current positive AMO (warm North Atlantic) conditions persist into the upcoming decade, we suggest two possible drought scenarios that resemble the continental-scale patterns of the 1930s (positive PDO) and 1950s (negative PDO) drought.},

Because there is considerable disagreement about whether contemporary wind trends support Bakun's hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis of the literature on upwelling-favorable wind intensification. The preponderance of published analyses suggests that winds have intensified in the California, Benguela, and Humboldt upwelling systems and weakened in the Iberian system over time scales ranging up to 60 years; wind change is equivocal in the Canary system. Stronger intensification signals are observed at higher latitudes, consistent with the warming pattern associated with climate change. Overall, reported changes in coastal winds, although subtle and spatially variable, support Bakun's hypothesis of upwelling intensification in eastern boundary current systems.},

abstract = {The process of a model adjusting to its forcing
(model spin-up) can severely bias land surface

model (LSM) output during the spin-up process. To
gain a better understanding of how spin-up processes
affect complex spatial and temporal land surface
modeling situations in general, and the
Retrospective North American Land Data Assimilation
System (NLDAS) simulations in particular, a
two-phase study was conducted. The first phase
examined results from Control, Wet, and Dry 11
year-long Mosaic simulations, while the second phase
attempted to explain spin-up behavior in NLDAS
Retrospective simulations from the Mosaic, Noah, VIC
and Sacramento LSMs based in part on the results
from phase 1. Total column and root zone soil
moisture spin up slowly, while evaporation and deep
soil temperature spin up more quickly. Mosaic soil
moisture initialization with NCEP/DOE Global
Reanalysis 2 (NCEP/DOE R-2) data (Control run) leads
to a faster spin-up time than saturated (Wet run) or
dry (Dry run) initialization, with the Control run
reaching equilibrium 1 to 2 years sooner than the
Wet run and 3 to 4 years more quickly than the Dry
run. Overall, practical drift of land surface stores
and output ceased in the Control run within
approximately 1 year, and fine-scale equilibrium was
reached within 5.5 years. Spin-up times exhibited
large spatial variability, and although no single
causal factor could be determined, they were
correlated most strongly with precipitation and
temperature forcing. In general, NLDAS models reach
a state of rough equilibrium within the first 1 to 2
years of the 3-year Retrospective simulation. The
Sacramento LSM has the shortest spin-up phase,
followed by the Mosaic, VIC, and Noah LSMs. Initial
NCEP/DOE R-2 conditions were too dry in general for
the VIC and Noah LSMs, and too moist for the Mosaic
and Sacramento LSMs. These results indicate that in
most cases, the 1-year spin-up time used in the
Retrospective NLDAS simulations eliminated spin-up
problems from the subsequent period that was used
for analysis.},

abstract = {Aims. We improve the description of the evolution of
the Sun's open and total magnetic flux on time
scales of years to millenia. Methods. In the model
employed here the evolution of the solar total and
open magnetic flux is computed from the flux
emerging at the solar surface in the form of bipolar
magnetic features, which is related to the sunspot
number cycle parameters and can be estimated from
historical records. Compared to earlier versions of
the model in addition to the long-lived open flux,
now also a more rapidly decaying component of the
open flux is considered. The model parameters are
constrained by comparing its output with
observations of the total surface magnetic flux and
with a reconstruction of the open magnetic flux
based on the geomagnetic indexes. A method to
compute the Sun's total magnetic flux and the
sunspot number during the Holocene, starting from
the open flux obtained from cosmogenic isotopes
records, is also presented. Results. By considering
separately a rapidly evolving and a slowly evolving
component of the open flux the model reproduces the
Sun's open flux, as reconstructed based on the
aa-index, much better and a reasonable description
of the radial component of interplanetary magnetic
field data is obtained. The greatest improvement is
in the reproduction of the cyclic variation of the
open flux, including the amplitudes of individual
cycles. Furthermore, we found that approximately
25{\%} of the modeled open flux values since the end
of the Maunder minimum are lower than the averaged
value over 2008, i.e. during the current low
minimum. The same proportion is observed in
reconstructions of the open flux during the Holocene
based on cosmogenic isotopes, which suggests that
the present solar minimum conditions are below
average, but not exceptional in terms of the
heliospheric magnetic flux.},

abstract = {In this study we analyzed the influence of the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon on
drought severity at the global scale. A unique
aspect of the analysis is that the ENSO influence
was quantified using a multiscalar drought
indicator, which allowed assessment of the role of
the ENSO phases on drought types affecting various
hydrological, agricultural and environmental
systems. The study was based on ENSO composites
corresponding to El Nino and La Nina phases, which
were obtained from the winter El Nino 3.4 index for
the period 1901-2006. Drought was identified in a
multiscalar way using the Standardized Precipitation
Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the global
SPEIbase data set. The study revealed the differing
impacts of the El Nino and La Nina phases on drought
severity, the time scales of droughts, and the
period of the year when the ENSO phases explained
drought variability worldwide. In large areas of
America and eastern Europe the role of ENSO events
were evident at the shortest time scales (1-3
months) at the beginning of events, but in areas of
South Africa, Australia and Southeast Asia the
effects were more obvious some months later, and at
longer time scales. We also identified areas where
severe drought conditions are associated with more
than 70{\%} of ENSO events. The persistence of the
drought signal at longer time-scales (e.g., 6- or
12-months) is not directly determined by the
atmospheric circulation response to the SST
anomalies, since the SPEI anomalies will be caused
by the cumulative dry conditions in some specific
months. Knowledge of how these effects differ as a
function of the El Nino and La Nina phases, and how
they propagate throughout the drought time scales
could aid in the prediction of the expected drought
severity associated with the ENSO. Lags detected
during the study may help forecasting of dry
conditions in some regions up to one year before
their occurrence.},

abstract = {A short nontechnical review of the Fl Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and the associated
teleconnections to higher latitudes is given. ENSO
has been shown to be predictable to some degree for
over a year ahead, which therefore provides a basis
for skillful prediction of interannual variations in
climate. The processes involved are emphasized in
order to highlight the areas where future research
may most profitably be directed to improve climate
forecasts. This progress has been realized through
the successful completion of the Tropical Oceans
Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Program of the World
Climate Research Program (WCRP), which has
established and maintained the TOGA Observing
System, developed coupled atmosphere-ocean models of
the tropical Pacific Ocean, demonstrated the
predictive capabilities noted above, and conducted
field programs to further the understanding of
physical processes. Future research will take place
in the context of a developing infrastructure
associated with operational climate
forecasts. Shea-term climate variability involves
much more than ENSO, and the challenge is to also
capitalize on long timescales associated with
anomalies in other parts of the climate system and
any additional predictability that goes beyond
simple persistence and build this into any
prediction scheme. The international framework for
helping to facilitate future research is
CLIVAR-GOALS, the WCRP program on climate
variability and predictability, and the subprogram
an the Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System. The
research challenges are many, but the prospects are
excellent for making further advances and the
potential is high for socioeconomic benefits for
many countries. Turning skillful but uncertain
forecasts into useful information and beneficial
decisions represents a particular challenge, so that
collaboration will be required between the physical
scientists and scientists from the applications and
social science communities.},

abstract = {Abstract By employing a heat budget analysis appropriate to zonally and time averaged conditions within the atmosphere, it is shown that the net downward heat flux Q at the ocean's surface can be expressed as Q = Q2 (TA*–Ts), where TA* is an apparent atmospheric equilibrium temperature, Ts the sea surface temperature, and Q2 a coefficient determined from the zonally and time averaged data. The latter coefficient, which is of the order of 70 ly day−1 (°C)−1, varies with latitude by as much as 20{\%}. It is suggested that the use of the above relation as a flux-type thermal boundary condition would allow for large-scale thermal coupling of ocean and atmosphere. The more common use of specified Ts as a boundary condition clearly does not allow for such coupling.},

abstract = {The rise in Arctic near-surface air temperatures has been almost twice as large as the global average in recent decades-a feature known as 'Arctic amplification'. Increased concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases have driven Arctic and global average warming; however, the underlying causes of Arctic amplification remain uncertain. The roles of reductions in snow and sea ice cover and changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation, cloud cover and water vapour are still matters of debate. A better understanding of the processes responsible for the recent amplified warming is essential for assessing the likelihood, and impacts, of future rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss. Here we show that the Arctic warming is strongest at the surface during most of the year and is primarily consistent with reductions in sea ice cover. Changes in cloud cover, in contrast, have not contributed strongly to recent warming. Increases in atmospheric water vapour content, partly in response to reduced sea ice cover, may have enhanced warming in the lower part of the atmosphere during summer and early autumn. We conclude that diminishing sea ice has had a leading role in recent Arctic temperature amplification. The findings reinforce suggestions that strong positive ice-temperature feedbacks have emerged in the Arctic, increasing the chances of further rapid warming and sea ice loss, and will probably affect polar ecosystems, ice-sheet mass balance and human activities in the Arctic.},

abstract = {Estimating the mean and the covariance matrix of an
incomplete dataset and filling in missing values
with imputed values is generally a nonlinear
problem, which must be solved iteratively. The
expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian
data, an iterative method both for the estimation of
mean values and covariance matrices from incomplete
datasets and for the imputation of missing values,
is taken as the point of departure for the
development of a regularized EM algorithm. In
contrast to the conventional EM algorithm, the
regularized EM algorithm is applicable to sets of
climate data, in which the number of variables
typically exceeds the sample size. The regularized
EM algorithm is based on iterated analyses of linear
regressions of variables with missing values on
variables with available values, with regression
coefficients estimated by ridge regression, a
regularized regression method in which a continuous
regularization parameter controls the filtering of
the noise in the data. The regularization parameter
is determined by generalized cross- validation, such
as to minimize, approximately, the expected mean-
squared error of the imputed values. The regularized
EM algorithm can estimate, and exploit for the
imputation of missing values, both synchronic and
diachronic covariance matrices, which may contain
information on spatial covariability, stationary
temporal covariability, or cyclostationary temporal
covariability. A test of the regularized EM
algorithm with simulated surface temperature data
demonstrates that the algorithm is applicable to
typical sets of climate data and that it leads to
more accurate estimates of the missing values than a
conventional noniterative imputation technique.},

abstract = {Pollen and high-resolution charcoal records from
three lakes were examined to reconstruct the
vegetation and fire history of the Oregon Coast
Range for the last 9000 years. The sites are located
along a north-to-south effective precipitation
gradient and changes in vegetation and fire activity
provided information on the nature of this gradient
in the past. The relation of vegetation to climate
change was examined at millennial timescales and the
relation between fire and climate was examined on
centennial timescales by comparing fire-interval
distribution and fire synchrony between sites. The
pollen data indicate more fire-adapted vegetation
during the early-Holocene period (c. 9000 to 6700
cal. yr BP), followed by a shift to forests with
more fire-sensitive taxa in the mid Holocene
(c. 6700 cal. yr BP to 2700 cal. yr BP) and modern
forest assemblages developing over the last c. 2700
years. Comparisons of fire-interval distributions
showed that the time between fires was similar
between two of the three combinations of sites,
suggesting that the moisture gradient has played an
important role in determining long-term fire
frequency. However, century-scale synchrony of fire
occurrence between the two sites with the largest
difference in effective precipitation suggests that
centennial-scale shifts in climate may have overcome
the environmental differences between these
locations. Asynchrony in fire occurrence between the
sites with more similar effective precipitation
implies that local conditions may have played an
important role in determining fire synchrony between
sites with similar long-term climate histories.},

Dynamical processes described by these distributions cannot be uniquely identified as belonging to one or the other class either by diverging variance due to power-law tails in the pdf or by the possible existence of skew. However, there are distinguishing features that may be found in sufficiently well sampled time series. We examine these features and discuss how they may guide the development of proper approximations to equations of motion underlying dynamical systems. An additional result of this research was the identification of a variable describing the relative importance of the multiplicative and independent additive noise forcing in our linear Markov process. The distribution of this variable is generally skewed, depending on the level of correlation between the additive and multiplicative noise.},

abstract = {A physically based conceptual framework is put
forward that explains why an increase in heavy
precipitation events should be a primary
manifestation of the climate change that accompanies
increases in greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere. Increased concentrations of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere increase downwelling
infrared radiation, and this global heating at the
surface not only acts to increase temperatures but
also increases evaporation which enhances the
atmospheric moisture content. Consequently all
weather systems, ranging from individual clouds and
thunderstorms to extratropical cyclones, which feed
on the available moisture through storm-scale
moisture convergence, are likely to produce
correspondingly enhanced precipitation
rates. Increases in heavy rainfall at the expense of
more moderate rainfall are the consequence along
with increased runoff and risk of flooding. However,
because of constraints in the surface energy budget,
there are also implications for the frequency and/or
efficiency of precipitation. It follows that
increased attention should be given to trends in
atmospheric moisture content, and datasets on hourly
precipitation rates and frequency need to be
developed and analyzed as well as total
accumulation.},

The degree of blocking by an orographic barrier, and therefore CAD intensity, is related to the static stability of the upstream air mass. When precipitation falls into dry near-surface air, differential evaporational cooling can increase static stability, and strengthen or initiate CAD. The sheltering effect of clouds can also maintain surface-based stability. Therefore, the ability of numerical forecast models to accurately predict CAD requires adequate representation of cloud and precipitation processes. Operational forecasters in the Appalachian damming region have previously developed a subjective classification scheme that distinguishes those CAD events that are heavily influenced by diabatic processes from those that are dominated by synoptic-scale forcing.

A widespread arctic air outbreak followed in early April, resulting in extensive agricultural losses over much of the south-central and southeastern US. This 'false spring' event also resulted in widespread damage to newly grown tissues of native deciduous forest species, shown by previous researchers to have had measurable effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle. The current study reconstructed the historical occurrence of false springs over most of the southeastern quarter of the conterminous US (32–39°N; 75–98°W) from 1901 to 2007 using daily maximum and minimum temperature records from 176 stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network database, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations. A false spring index was derived that examined the timing of the start of the growing season (SGS), or leaf emergence, relative to the timing of a potentially damaging last hard freeze (minimum temperature ≤ −  2.2 °C). SGS was modeled for the domain by combining EVI data with ground-based temperature 'degree day' calculations reflecting the rate of springtime warming. No significant area-wide, long-term SGS trend was found; however, over much of a contiguous region stretching from Mississippi eastward to the Carolinas, the timing of the last hard freeze was found to occur significantly later, this change occurring along with increased frequency of false springs. Earlier last hard freeze dates and decreased frequency of false springs were found over much of the northwestern part of the study region, including Arkansas and southern Missouri.},

Recent measurements of absorptivities obtained for a wide range of pressure are used, and the scheme of computation is sufficiently general to include the effect of several layers of clouds. The atmosphere in thermal equilibrium has an isothermal lower stratosphere and an inversion in the upper stratosphere which are features observed in middle latitudes. The role of various gaseous absorbers (i.e., water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone), as well as the role of the clouds, is investigated by computing thermal equilibrium with and without one or two of these elements. The existence of ozone has very little effect on the equilibrium temperature of the earth's surface but a very important effect on the temperature throughout the stratosphere; the absorption...},

abstract = {Rapid Arctic warming and sea-ice reduction in the Arctic Ocean are widely attributed to anthropogenic climate change. The Arctic warming exceeds the global average warming because of feedbacks that include sea-ice reduction and other dynamical and radiative feedbacks. We find that the most prominent annual mean surface and tropospheric warming in the Arctic since 1979 has occurred in northeastern Canada and Greenland. In this region, much of the year-to-year temperature variability is associated with the leading mode of large-scale circulation variability in the North Atlantic, namely, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Here we show that the recent warming in this region is strongly associated with a negative trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation, which is a response to anomalous Rossby wave-train activity originating in the tropical Pacific. Atmospheric model experiments forced by prescribed tropical sea surface temperatures simulate the observed circulation changes and associated tropospheric and surface warming over northeastern Canada and Greenland. Experiments from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (ref. 16) models with prescribed anthropogenic forcing show no similar circulation changes related to the North Atlantic Oscillation or associated tropospheric warming. This suggests that a substantial portion of recent warming in the northeastern Canada and Greenland sector of the Arctic arises from unforced natural variability.},

abstract = {This paper deals primarily with the 1988 summer
drought over much of the contiguous United States
and its generation from conditions during the
preceding spring. Both the spring and summer
environment are described in terms of hemispheric
flow patterns in midtroposphere, temperature and
precipitation anomalies, and sea surface temperature
anomalies. Conditions in March were especially
indicative of the ensuing drought, since a model
routinely employed in long-range forecasting showed
that the March circulation would most likely be
followed by a hot dry April, May, and June over much
of the nation-a pattern which persisted into early
summer. This result suggests that the initiation of
the drought was rooted in extratropical climate
variations, an alternative hypothesis to one which
attributes the persistent drought-producing
circulation to oceanic and atmospheric conditions in
the tropics. In many respects the summer drought of
1988 was similar to earlier great droughts of the
Great Plains, although it was spatially more
extensive. Attempts by three forecast groups to
predict the summer conditions from spring's were
moderately successful, though none of these
anticipated the drought's severity and extent. The
underlying reasons for the summer forecast made by
the author are verified using objective tools.
Premonitory signs showed up in antecedent seasons
when deficient precipitation occurred, when
climatological contingencies provided alerts, and
when extratropical sea surface temperature patterns
evolved in a conducive manner. A new modified
barotropic model iterating from the May
midtropospheric height pattern using a mean summer
estimate of seasonal forcing produces a reasonably
successful estimate of the summer circulation and,
in retrospect, even more so when initialized from
the March height pattern for the April, May, and
June period of inception.},

Upper Colorado tributaries: the White, Yampa, and
Little Snake Rivers. Based on tree rings, these
records represent the first paleohydrological
reconstructions from these subbasins to overlap with
a series of Medieval droughts (similar to AD 800 to
1300). The reconstructions show marked interannual
variability imbedded in nonstationary behavior over
decadal to multidecadal time scales. These
reconstructions suggest that, even in a millennial
context, gaged flows from a handful of years (e. g.,
1977 and 2002) were extremely dry. However, droughts
of much greater duration and magnitude than any in
the instrumental record were regular features prior
to 1900. Likewise these reconstructions point to the
unusual wetness of the gage period, and the
potential for recent observations to paint an overly
optimistic picture of regional water supplies. The
future of the Upper Colorado River will be
determined by a combination of inherent
hydro-climatic variability and a broad range of

The satellite products are based on three different retrieval methods: an energy budget approach, measurements of ice freeboard, and the relationship between passive microwave brightness temperatures and thin ice thickness. Inter-comparisons are done for the periods of overlap from 2003 to 2013. Results show that ICESat sea ice is thicker than APP-x and PIOMAS overall, particularly along the north coast of Greenland and Canadian Archipelago. The relative differences of APP-x and PIOMAS with ICESat are −0.48 m and −0.31 m, respectively. APP-x underestimates thickness relative to CryoSat-2, with a mean difference of −0.19 m. The biases for APP-x, PIOMAS, and CryoSat-2 relative to IceBridge thicknesses are 0.18 m, 0.18 m, and 0.29 m. The mean difference between SMOS and CryoSat-2 for 0{\~{}}1 m thick ice is 0.13 m in March and −0.24 m in October. All satellite-retrieved ice thickness products and PIOMAS overestimate the thickness of thin ice (1 m or less) compared to IceBridge for which SMOS has the smallest bias (0.26 m).

of the hydrological cycle and water supply in the
region. A formal model-based detection and
attribution (D-A) study of these reductions is
performed. The detection variable is the ratio of 1
April snow water equivalent (SWE) to
water-year-to-date precipitation (P), chosen to
reduce the effect of P variability on the
results. Estimates of natural internal climate
variability are obtained from 1600 years of two
control simulations performed with fully coupled
ocean-atmosphere climate models. Estimates of the
SWE/P response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases,
ozone, and some aerosols are taken from
multiple-member ensembles of perturbation
experiments run with two models. The D-A shows the
observations and anthropogenically forced models
have greater SWE/P reductions than can be explained
by natural internal climate variability alone.
Model-estimated effects of changes in solar and
volcanic forcing likewise do not explain the SWE/P
reductions. The mean model estimate is that about
half of the SWE/P reductions observed in the west
from 1950 to 1999 are the result of climate changes
forced by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, ozone, and
aerosols.},

Part I of the study) are evaluated with respect to
the three dominant modes of global SST. Two of these
modes are associated with the statistically
significant, naturally occurring interannual and
interdecadal variability in the Pacific. The
remaining mode corresponds to the recent warming of
tropical sea surface temperatures. Time-evolving
teleconnections associated with Pacific SSTs delay
or accelerate the evolution of the North American
monsoon. At the period of maximum teleconnectivity
in late June and early July, there is an opposite
relationship between precipitation in the core
monsoon region and the central United States. Use of
a regional climate model (RCM) is essential to
capture this variability because of its
representation of the diurnal cycle of convective
rainfall. The RCM also captures the observed
long-term changes in Mexican summer rainfall and
suggests that these changes are due in part to the
recent increase in eastern Pacific SST off the
Mexican coast. To establish the physical linkage to
remote SST forcing, additional RAMS seasonal weather
prediction mode simulations were performed and these
results are briefly discussed. In order for RCMs to
be successful in a seasonal weather prediction mode
for the summer season, it is required that the GCM
provide a reasonable representation of the
teleconnections and have a climatology that is
comparable to a global atmospheric reanalysis.},

This data record shows that the long-term annual mean export is about 880?000?km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, representing 10?{\%} of the sea-ice-covered area inside the basin. The time series has large interannual and multi-decadal variability but no long-term trend. However, during the last decades, the amount of ice exported has increased, with several years having annual ice exports that exceeded 1?million?km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. This increase is a result of faster southward ice drift speeds due to stronger southward geostrophic winds, largely explained by increasing surface pressure over Greenland. Evaluating the trend onwards from 1979 reveals an increase in annual ice export of about +6?{\%} per decade, with spring and summer showing larger changes in ice export (+11?{\%} per decade) compared to autumn and winter (+2.6?{\%} per decade). Increased ice export during winter will generally result in new ice growth and contributes to thinning inside the Arctic Basin. Increased ice export during summer or spring will, in contrast, contribute directly to open water further north and a reduced summer sea ice extent through the ice?albedo feedback. Relatively low spring and summer export from 1950 to 1970 is thus consistent with a higher mid-September sea ice extent for these years. Our results are not sensitive to long-term change in Fram Strait sea ice concentration. We find a general moderate influence between export anomalies and the following September sea ice extent, explaining 18?{\%} of the variance between 1935 and 2014, but with higher values since 2004.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Each component has increased its heat content (the atmosphere and the ocean) or exhibited melting (the cryosphere). The estimated increase of observed global ocean heat content (over the depth range from 0 to 3000 meters) between the 1950s and 1990s is at least one order of magnitude larger than the increase in heat content of any other component. Simulation results using an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model that includes estimates of the radiative effects of observed temporal variations in greenhouse gases, sulfate aerosols, solar irradiance, and volcanic aerosols over the past century agree with our observation-based estimate of the increase in ocean heat content. The results we present suggest that the observed increase in ocean heat content may largely be due to the increase of anthropogenic gases in Earth's atmosphere.},

quantitative assessments of the triggers and
potential extent of drought-induced vegetation

climate-change impacts. Of particular concern is
regional-scale mortality of overstory trees, which
rapidly alters ecosystem type, associated ecosystem
properties, and land surface conditions for
decades. Here, we quantify regional-scale vegetation
die-off across southwestern North American woodlands
in 2002-2003 in response to drought and associated
bark beetle infestations. At an intensively studied
site within the region, we quantified that after 15
months of depleted soil water content, {\textgreater}90{\%} of the
dominant, overstory tree species (Pinus edulis, a
pinon) died. The die-off was reflected in changes in
a remotely sensed index of vegetation greenness
(Normalized Difference Vegetation index), not only
at the intensively studied site but also across the
region, extending over 12,000 km(2) or more; aerial
and field surveys confirmed the general extent of
the die-off. Notably, the recent drought was warmer
than the previous subcontinental drought of the
1950s. The limited, available observations suggest
that die-off from the recent drought was more
extensive than that from the previous drought,
extending into wetter sites within the tree species'
distribution. Our results quantify a trigger leading
to rapid, drought-induced die-off of overstory woody
plants at subcontinental scale and highlight the
potential for such die-off to be more severe and
extensive for future global-change-type drought

abstract = {The decadal-scale variability in the tropical
Pacific has been analyzed herein by means of
observations and numerical model simulations. The
two leading modes of the sea surface temperature
(SST) variability in the central western Pacific are
a decadal mode with a period of about 10 yr and the
ENSO mode with a dominant period of about 4 yr. The
SST anomaly pattern of the decadal mode is ENSO
like. The decadal mode, however, explains most
variance in the western equatorial Pacific and off
the equator. A simulation with an ocean general
circulation model (OGCM) forced by reanalysis data
is used to explore the origin of the decadal
mode. It is found that the variability of the
shallow subtropical - tropical overturning cells is
an important factor in driving the decadal
mode. This is supported by results from a
multicentury integration with a coupled ocean -
atmosphere general circulation model (CGCM) that
realistically simulates tropical Pacific decadal
variability. Finally, the sensitivity of the shallow
subtropical - tropical overturning cells to
greenhouse warming is discussed by analyzing the
results of a scenario integration with the same
CGCM.},

Knowledge of the natural variability of sea ice thickness is therefore critical for its representation in global climate models. Numerical simulations suggest that Arctic ice thickness varies primarily on decadal timescales owing to changes in wind and ocean stresses on the ice, but observations have been unable to provide a synoptic view of sea ice thickness, which is required to validate the model results. Here we use an eight-year time-series of Arctic ice thickness, derived from satellite altimeter measurements of ice freeboard, to determine the mean thickness field and its variability from 65 degrees N to 81.5 degrees N. Our data reveal a high-frequency interannual variability in mean Arctic ice thickness that is dominated by changes in the amount of summer melt, rather than by changes in circulation. Our results suggest that a continued increase in melt season length would lead to further thinning of Arctic sea ice.},

abstract = {A physically based hydrology model is used to
produce time series for the period 1916 - 2003 of
evapo-transpiration (ET), runoff, and soil moisture
(SM) over the western United States from which long-
term trends are evaluated. The results show that
trends in ET in spring and summer are determined
primarily by trends in precipitation and snowmelt
that determine water availability. From April to
June, ET trends are mostly positive due primarily to
earlier snowmelt and earlier emergence of snow-free
ground, and secondarily to increasing trends in
spring precipitation. From July to September trends
in ET are more strongly influenced by precipitation
trends, with the exception of areas (most notably
California) that receive little summer precipitation
and have experienced large changes in snowmelt
timing. Trends in the seasonal timing of ET are
modest, but during the period 1947 - 2003 when
temperature trends are large, they reflect a shift
of ET from midsummer to early summer and late
spring. As in other studies, it is found that runoff
is occurring earlier in spring, a trend that is
related primarily to increasing temperature, and is
most apparent during 1947 - 2003. Trends in the
annual runoff ratio, a variable critical to western
water management, are determined primarily by trends
in cool season precipitation, rather than changes in
the timing of runoff or ET. It was found that the
signature of temperature- related trends in runoff
and SM is strongly keyed to mean midwinter [December
- February (DJF)] temperatures. Areas with warmer
winter temperatures show increasing trends in the
runoff fraction as early as February, and colder
areas as late as June. Trends toward earlier spring
SM recharge are apparent and increasing trends in SM
on 1 April are evident over much of the region. The
1 July SM trends are less affected by snowmelt
changes and are controlled more by precipitation
trends.},

strong enough to explain the cooling reconstructed

Already in A. D. 800, the surface energy balance was
altered by ALCC at a strength comparable to

However, the underlying cause of this increased surface melting and how it relates to cryospheric changes across the Arctic remain unclear. Here we show that an important contributing factor is the decreasing Arctic sea ice. Reduced summer sea ice favors stronger and more frequent occurrences of blocking-high pressure events over Greenland. Blocking highs enhance the transport of warm, moist air over Greenland, which increases downwelling infrared radiation, contributes to increased extreme heat events, and accounts for the majority of the observed warming trends. These findings are supported by analyses of observations and reanalysis data, as well as by independent atmospheric model simulations using a state-of-the-art atmospheric model that is forced by varying only the sea ice conditions. Reduced sea ice conditions in the model favor more extensive Greenland surface melting. We find that a positive feedback betwe...},

Thinner ice amplifies the atmospheric temperature sensitivity in these experiments by about 15{\%} (to a warming of 4.8°C), because it is easier for the thinner ice to be removed as the climate warms. Thus, its impact on sensitivity is similar to that of greater sea ice extent in the control run, which provides more opportunity for sea ice reduction. An experiment with sea ice not allowed to change between the control and doubled CO2 simulations illustrates that the total effect of sea ice on surface air temperature changes, including cloud cover and water vapor feedbacks that arise in response to sea ice variations, amounts to 37{\%} of the temperature sensitivity to the CO2 doubling, accounting for 1.56°C of the 4.17°C global warming.

for each region and sector, is then forced to agree
with our 2000 estimate, ensuring continuity between
past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two

capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone,
carbon monoxide and aerosol distributions. The
simulated long-term change in the Northern
mid-latitudes surface and mid-troposphere ozone is
not quite as rapid as observed. However, stations
outside this latitude band show much better
agreement in both present-day and long-term

concentration of carbon monoxide is underestimated
at the Mace Head station; however, the long-term
trend over the limited observational period seems to
be reasonably well captured. The simulated sulfate

very good agreement with the ice-core observations

provided an unprecedented observing network for
studying the structure and evolution of the North
American monsoon. This paper focuses on multiscale
characteristics of the flow during NAME from the
large scale to the mesoscale using atmospheric
sounding data from the enhanced observing network.
The onset of the 2004 summer monsoon over the NAME
region accompanied the typical northward shift of
the upper-level anticyclone or monsoon high over
northern Mexico into the southwestern United States,
but in 2004 this shift occurred slightly later than
normal and the monsoon high did not extend as far
north as usual. Consequently, precipitation over the
southwestern United States was slightly below
normal, although increased troughiness over the
Great Plains contributed to increased rainfall over
eastern New Mexico and western Texas. The first
major pulse of moisture into the Southwest occurred
around 13 July in association with a strong Gulf of
California surge. This surge was linked to the
westward passages of Tropical Storm Blas to the
south and an upper-level inverted trough over
northern Texas. The development of Blas appeared to
be favored as an easterly wave moved into the
eastern Pacific during the active phase of a
Madden-Julian oscillation. On the regional scale,
sounding data reveal a prominent sea breeze along
the east shore of the Gulf of California, with a
deep return flow as a consequence of the elevated
Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO) immediately to the
east. Subsidence produced a dry layer over the gulf,
whereas a deep moist layer existed over the west
slopes of the SMO. A prominent nocturnal low-level
jet was present on most days over the northern
gulf. The diurnal cycle of heating and moistening
(Q1 and Q2) over the SMO was characterized by deep
convective profiles in the mid- to upper troposphere
at 1800 LT, followed by stratiform-like profiles at
midnight, consistent with the observed diurnal
evolution of precipitation over this coastal
mountainous region. The analyses in the core NAME
domain are based on a gridded dataset derived from
atmospheric soundings only and, therefore, should
prove useful in validating reanalyses and regional
models.},

failures with profound socioeconomic impacts have
punctuated Mexican history. However, reliable
records of maize harvest have not been available
until very recently, and historical records of crop
yield and price are discontinuous and can be
difficult to interpret. We have developed a
continuous, exactly dated, tree-ring reconstruction
of maize yield variability in central Mexico from
1474 to 2001 that provides new insight into the
history of climate and food availability in the
heartland of the Mesoamerican cultural province. The
reconstruction indicates that seven of the most
severe agricultural crises in Mexican history
occurred during decadal-scale episodes of
reconstructed maize shortfalls.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Arctic sea ice thickness distributions from models participating in the World Climate Research Programme Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) are evaluated against observations from submarines, aircraft and satellites. While it is encouraging that the mean thickness distributions from the models are in general agreement with observations, the spatial patterns of sea ice thickness are poorly represented in most models. The poor spatial representation of thickness patterns is associated with a failure of models to represent details of the mean atmospheric circulation pattern that governs the transport and spatial distribution of sea ice. The climate models as a whole also tend to underestimate the rate of ice volume loss from 1979 to 2013, though the multimodel ensemble mean trend remains within the uncertainty of that from the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System. Although large uncertainties in observational products complicate model evaluations, these results raise concerns regarding the ability of CMIP5 models to realistically represent the processes driving the decline of Arctic sea ice and to project the timing of when a seasonally ice-free Arctic may become a reality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Research Unit (CRU) land station temperature
database that has been used to produce a grid-box
data set of 5 degrees latitude x 5 degrees longitude
temperature anomalies. The new database (CRUTEM4)
comprises 5583 station records of which 4842 have
enough data for the 1961-1990 period to calculate or
estimate the average temperatures for this
period. Many station records have had their data
replaced by newly homogenized series that have been
produced by a number of studies, particularly from
National Meteorological Services (NMSs). Hemispheric
temperature averages for land areas developed with
the new CRUTEM4 data set differ slightly from their
CRUTEM3 equivalent. The inclusion of much additional
data from the Arctic (particularly the Russian
Arctic) has led to estimates for the Northern
Hemisphere (NH) being warmer by about 0.1 degrees C
for the years since 2001. The NH/Southern Hemisphere
(SH) warms by 1.12 degrees C/0.84 degrees C over the
period 1901-2010. The robustness of the hemispheric
averages is assessed by producing five different
analyses, each including a different subset of 20{\%}
of the station time series and by omitting some
large countries. CRUTEM4 is also compared with
hemispheric averages produced by reanalyses
undertaken by the European Centre for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF): ERA-40 (1958-2001) and
ERA-Interim (1979-2010) data sets. For the NH,
agreement is good back to 1958 and excellent from
1979 at monthly, annual, and decadal time
scales. For the SH, agreement is poorer, but if the
area is restricted to the SH north of 60 degrees S,
the agreement is dramatically improved from the
mid-1970s.},

abstract = {The year 2010 featured a widespread drought in the
Amazon rain forest, which was more severe than the
"once-in-a-century" drought of 2005. Water levels of
major Amazon tributaries fell drastically to
unprecedented low values, and isolated the
floodplain population whose transportation depends
upon on local streams which completely dried up. The
drought of 2010 in Amazonia started in early austral
summer during El Nino and then was intensified as a
consequence of the warming of the tropical North
Atlantic. An observed tendency for an increase in
dry and very dry events, particularly in southern
Amazonia during the dry season, is concomitant with
an increase in the length of the dry season. Our
results suggest that it is by means of a longer dry
season that warming in the tropical North Atlantic
affects the hydrology of the Amazon Rivers at the
end of the recession period (austral spring). This
process is, sometimes, further aggravated by
deficient rainfall in the previous wet
season. Citation: Marengo, J. A., J. Tomasella,

Other scientific objectives of ICESat include: global measurements of cloud heights and the vertical structure of clouds and aerosols; precise measurements of land topography and vegetation canopy heights; and measurements of sea ice roughness, sea ice thickness, ocean surface elevations, and surface reflectivity. The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on ICESat has a 1064 nm laser channel for surface altimetry and dense cloud heights and a 532 nm lidar channel for the vertical distribution of clouds and aerosols. The predicted accuracy for the surface-elevation measurements is 15 cm, averaged over 60 m diameter laser footprints spaced at 172 m along-track. The orbital altitude will be around 600 km at an inclination of 94° with a 183-day repeat pattern. The on-board GPS receiver will enable radial orbit determinations to better than 5 cm, and star-trackers will enable footprints to be located to 6 m horizontally. The spacecraft attitude will be controlled to point the laser beam to within±35 m of reference surface tracks at high latitudes.

abstract = {We investigate the roles of climate forcings and
chaos (unforced variability) in climate change via
ensembles of climate simulations in which we add
forcings one by one. The experiments suggest that
most interannual climate variability in the period
1979-1996 at middle and high latitudes is
chaotic. But observed SST anomalies, which
themselves are partly forced and partly chaotic,
account for much of the climate variability at low
latitudes and a small portion of the variability at
high latitudes. Both a natural radiative forcing
(volcanic aerosols) and an anthropogenic forcing
(ozone depletion) leave clear signatures in the
simulated climate change that are identified in
observations. Pinatubo aerosols warm the
stratosphere and cool the surface glc:,ally, causing
a tendency for regional surface cooling. Ozone
depletion cools the lower stratosphere, troposphere
and surface, steepening the temperature lapse rate
in the troposphere. Solar irradiance effects are
small, but our model is inadequate to fully explore
this forcing. Well-mixed anthropogenic greenhouse
gases cause a large surface warming that, over the
17 years, approximately offsets cooling by the other
three mechanisms. Thus the net calculated effect of
all measured radiative forcings is approximately
zero surface temperature trend and zero heat storage
in the ocean for the period 1979-1996. Finally, in
addition to the four measured radiative forcings, we
add an initial (1979) disequilibrium forcing of
+0.65 W/m(2). This forcing yields a global surface
warming of about 0.2 degrees C over 1979-1996, close
to observations, and measurable heat storage in the
ocean. We argue that the results represent evidence
of a planetary radiative imbalance of at least 0.5
W/m(2); this disequilibrium presumably represents
unrealized warming due to changes of atmospheric
composition prior to 1979. One implication of the
disequilibrium forcing is an expectation of new
record global temperatures in the next few
years. The best opportunity for observational
confirmation of the disequilibrium is measurement of
ocean temperatures adequate to define heat storage.},

abstract = {The decline of Arctic sea ice is an integral part of anthropogenic climate change. Sea-ice loss is already having a significant impact on Arctic communities and ecosystems. Its role as a cause of climate changes outside of the Arctic has also attracted much scientific interest. Evidence is mounting that Arctic sea-ice loss can affect weather and climate throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The remote impacts of Arctic sea-ice loss can only be properly represented using models that simulate interactions among the ocean, sea ice, land and atmosphere. A synthesis of six such experiments with different models shows consistent hemispheric-wide atmospheric warming, strongest in the mid-to-high-latitude lower troposphere; an intensification of the wintertime Aleutian Low and, in most cases, the Siberian High; a weakening of the Icelandic Low; and a reduction in strength and southward shift of the mid-latitude westerly winds in winter. The atmospheric circulation response seems to be sensitive to the magnitude and geographic pattern of sea-ice loss and, in some cases, to the background climate state. However, it is unclear whether current-generation climate models respond too weakly to sea-ice change. We advocate for coordinated experiments that use different models and observational constraints to quantify the climate response to Arctic sea-ice loss.},

abstract = {The centuries-old practice of recording plant and
animal events that take place at specific times each
year (phenology) should play an important role in
monitoring mid-latitude global changes. At least
three problems related to the detection of biosphere
changes could be investigated using this
information. Firstly, the technique can be
generalized from the local to global
scale. Secondly, an integrated approach could be
developed to represent biome diversity
effectively. Lastly, physical mechanisms responsible
for the events can be deduced in order to
incorporate the phenological information into
global-scale models, and detect changes in related
environmental factors. With these goals in mind,
regional phenological data collection networks were
initiated in eastern North America during the early
1960s, using cloned lilacs and several species of
honeysuckle. This paper reviews research projects
which address the problems outlined above, using
first leaf data (associated with spring green-up or
''green wave'' in mid-latitudes) gathered from these
networks. The results of such studies in North
America have demonstrated the potential of phenology
as an efficient monitor of global change throughout
mid-latitude regions. Future research efforts will
concentrate on the development of a coordinated
strategy to link phenological information from
satellites, indicator plants (such as the lilac),
and representative species from each biome.},

abstract = {Five-needle pines provide some of the world's
longest chronologies of paleoclimate interest. We
examined 66 five-needle pine growth chronologies
from 1896 to their end years using linear trend,
correlation, and cluster analyses. Chronologies were
categorized based on the sites' proximity to upper
treeline. A significant positive trend in ring width
over the post-1896 interval was most common in upper
treeline chronologies, but positive linear trend was
found in all elevational proximity classes and all
species. Cluster analysis of climate response
patterns identified four groups exhibiting strong
associations with (i) positive response to previous
autumn, winter, and spring precipitation, (ii)
positive response to spring and (or) summer
precipitation Coupled with an inverse relationship
with Summer temperature, (iii) positive response to
winter and (or) spring precipitation coupled with an
inverse relationship with spring temperature, and
(iv) positive associations With temperature in all
seasons except spring and no appreciative
precipitation response. Most chronologies positively
associated with temperatures were from sites located
near upper treeline and also contain significant
positive linear trend. Our results suggest that some
five-needle pine treeline chronologies may be
reliable predictors of past temperatures, but
careful site selection is required.},

abstract = {Climate change poses threats to human health, safety, and survival via weather extremes and climatic impacts on food yields, fresh water, infectious diseases, conflict, and displacement. Paradoxically, these risks to health are neither widely nor fully recognized. Historical experiences of diverse societies experiencing climatic changes, spanning multicentury to single-year duration, provide insights into population health vulnerability--even though most climatic changes were considerably less than those anticipated this century and beyond. Historical experience indicates the following. (i) Long-term climate changes have often destabilized civilizations, typically via food shortages, consequent hunger, disease, and unrest. (ii) Medium-term climatic adversity has frequently caused similar health, social, and sometimes political consequences. (iii) Infectious disease epidemics have often occurred in association with briefer episodes of temperature shifts, food shortages, impoverishment, and social disruption. (iv) Societies have often learnt to cope (despite hardship for some groups) with recurring shorter-term (decadal to multiyear) regional climatic cycles (e.g., El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation)--except when extreme phases occur. (v) The drought-famine-starvation nexus has been the main, recurring, serious threat to health. Warming this century is not only likely to greatly exceed the Holocene's natural multidecadal temperature fluctuations but to occur faster. Along with greater climatic variability, models project an increased geographic range and severity of droughts. Modern societies, although larger, better resourced, and more interconnected than past societies, are less flexible, more infrastructure-dependent, densely populated, and hence are vulnerable. Adverse historical climate-related health experiences underscore the case for abating human-induced climate change.},

of the atmospheric circulation over the continent,
with a research literature that dates back almost
100 years. The authors review the wide range of past
and current research dealing with the meteorological
and climatological aspects of the North American
monsoon, highlighting historical development and
major research themes. The domain of the North
American monsoon is large, extending over much of
the western United States from its region of
greatest influence in northwestern Mexico. Regarding
the debate over moisture source regions and water
vapor advection into southwestern North America,
there is general agreement that the bulk of monsoon
moisture is advected at low levels from the eastern
tropical Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California,
while the Gulf of Mexico may contribute some
upper-level moisture (although mixing occurs over
the Sierra Madre Occidental). Surges of low-level
moisture from the Gulf of California are a
significant part of intraseasonal monsoon
variability, and they are associated with the
configuration of upper-level midlatitude troughs and
tropical easterly waves at the synoptic scale, as
well as the presence of low-level jets, a thermal
low, and associated dynamics (including the
important effects of local topography) at the
mesoscale. Seasonally, the gulf surges and the
latitudinal position of the midtropospheric
subtropical ridge over southwestern North America
appear to be responsible for much spatial and
temporal variability in precipitation. Interannual
variability of the North American monsoon system is
high, but it is not strongly linked to El Nino or
other common sources of interannual circulation
variability. Recent mesoscale field measurements
gathered during the South-West Area Monsoon Project
have highlighted the complex nature of the
monsoon-related severe storm environment and
associated difficulties in modeling and
forecasting.},

For each model, two simulations were performed in order to isolate the impact of climate change on the land and ocean carbon cycle, and therefore the climate feedback on the atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate. There was unanimous agreement among the models that future climate change will reduce the efficiency of the earth system to absorb the anthropogenic carbon perturbation. A larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The high...},

an overlying climate that has a strong seasonality,
similar climate zones to where trees grow with
distinct annual rings. Continuous laminated

reconstruct climate, particularly through variations

relatively damped by mixing of 'event' water with
'stored' groundwater, constraining the amount of
high-frequency climate signals contained in the
stalagmite, but relatively long continuous lamina
sequences permit the preservation of low frequency,
centennial scale, climate signals. This contrasts
with numerous tree ring climate records, which are
frequently limited in preserving multi-centennial
trends, due to the necessary removal of age related
noise from relatively short tree segments. Laminated
stalagmites and tree rings should therefore to some
degree provide complementary climate
information. Appropriate methods for compiling

abstract = {An analysis and evaluation has been performed of
global datasets on column-integrated water vapor
(precipitable water). For years before 1996, the
Ross and Elliott radiosonde dataset is used for
validation of European Centre for Medium-range
Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalyses ERA-40. Only
the special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) dataset
from remote sensing systems (RSS) has credible
means, variability and trends for the oceans, but it
is available only for the post-1988 period. Major
problems are found in the means, variability and
trends from 1988 to 2001 for both reanalyses from
National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)
and the ERA-40 reanalysis over the oceans, and for
the NASA water vapor project (NVAP) dataset more
generally. NCEP and ERA-40 values are reasonable
over land where constrained by
radiosondes. Accordingly, users of these data should
take great care in accepting results as real. The
problems highlight the need for reprocessing of
data, as has been done by RSS, and reanalyses that
adequately take account of the changing observing
system. Precipitable water variability for 1988-2001
is dominated by the evolution of ENSO and especially
the structures that occurred during and following
the 1997-98 El Nino event. The evidence from SSM/I
for the global ocean suggests that recent trends in
precipitable water are generally positive and, for
1988 through 2003, average 0.40 +/- 0.09 mm per
decade or 1.3 +/- 0.3{\%} per decade for the ocean as
a whole, where the error bars are 95{\%} confidence
intervals. Over the oceans, the precipitable water
variability relates very strongly to changes in
SSTs, both in terms of spatial structure of trends
and temporal variability (with regression
coefficient for 30 degrees N-30 degrees S of 7.8{\%}
K-1) and is consistent with the assumption of fairly
constant relative humidity. In the tropics, the
trends are also influenced by changes in rainfall
which, in turn, are closely associated with the mean
flow and convergence of moisture by the trade
winds. The main region where positive trends are not
very evident is over Europe, in spite of large and
positive trends over the North Atlantic since
1988. A much longer time series is probably required
to obtain stable patterns of trends over the oceans,
although the main variability could probably be
deduced from past SST and associated precipitation
variations.},

abstract = {We provide an overview of geoengineering by stratospheric sulphate aerosols. The state of understanding about this topic as of early 2008 is reviewed, summarizing the past 30 years of work in the area, highlighting some very recent studies using climate models, and discussing methods used to deliver sulphur species to the stratosphere. The studies reviewed here suggest that sulphate aerosols can counteract the globally averaged temperature increase associated with increasing greenhouse gases, and reduce changes to some other components of the Earth system. There are likely to be remaining regional climate changes after geoengineering, with some regions experiencing significant changes in temperature or precipitation. The aerosols also serve as surfaces for heterogeneous chemistry resulting in increased ozone depletion. The delivery of sulphur species to the stratosphere in a way that will produce particles of the right size is shown to be a complex and potentially very difficult task. Two simple delivery scenarios are explored, but similar exercises will be needed for other suggested delivery mechanisms. While the introduction of the geoengineering source of sulphate aerosol will perturb the sulphur cycle of the stratosphere signicantly, it is a small perturbation to the total (stratosphere and troposphere) sulphur cycle. The geoengineering source would thus be a small contributor to the total global source of 'acid rain' that could be compensated for through improved pollution control of anthropogenic tropospheric sources. Some areas of research remain unexplored. Although ozone may be depleted, with a consequent increase to solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) energy reaching the surface and a potential impact on health and biological populations, the aerosols will also scatter and attenuate this part of the energy spectrum, and this may compensate the UVB enhancement associated with ozone depletion. The aerosol will also change the ratio of diffuse to direct energy reaching the surface, and this may influence ecosystems. The impact of geoengineering on these components of the Earth system has not yet been studied. Representations for the formation, evolution and removal of aerosol and distribution of particle size are still very crude, and more work will be needed to gain confidence in our understanding of the deliberate production of this class of aerosols and their role in the climate system.},

abstract = {Abstract Climate in the North Pacific and North American sectors has experienced interdecadal shifts during the twentieth century. A network of recently developed tree-ring chronologies for Southern and Baja California extends the instrumental record and reveals decadal-scale variability back to 1661. The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) is closely matched by the dominant mode of tree-ring variability that provides a preliminary view of multiannual climate fluctuations spanning the past four centuries. The reconstructed PDO index features a prominent bidecadal oscillation, whose amplitude weakened in the late l700s to mid-1800s. A comparison with proxy records of ENSO suggests that the greatest decadal-scale oscillations in Pacific climate between 1706 and 1977 occurred around 1750, 1905, and 1947.},

abstract = {The response of marine and terrestrial environments to global changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentrations will likely be governed by both responses to direct environmental forcing and responses to Earth-system feedbacks induced by that forcing. It has been proposed that anthropogenic greenhouse forcing will intensify coastal upwelling in eastern boundary current regions [Bakun, A. (1990) Science 247, 198-201]. Focusing on the California Current, we show that biophysical land-cover-atmosphere feedbacks induced by CO(2) radiative forcing enhance the radiative effects of CO(2) on land-sea thermal contrast, resulting in changes in eastern boundary current total seasonal upwelling and upwelling seasonality. Specifically, relative to CO(2) radiative forcing, land-cover-atmosphere feedbacks lead to a stronger increase in peak- and late-season near-shore upwelling in the northern limb of the California Current and a stronger decrease in peak- and late-season near-shore upwelling in the southern limb. Such changes will impact both marine and terrestrial communities [Bakun, A. (1990) Science 247, 198-201; Soto, C. G. (2001) Rev. Fish Biol. Fish. 11, 181-195; and Agostini, V. N. {\&} Bakun, A. (2002) Fish. Oceanogr. 11, 129-142], and these and other Earth-system feedbacks should be expected to play a substantial role in shaping the response of eastern boundary current regions to CO(2) radiative forcing.},

processes. Sediment flux comprises alternating
diatom ooze/diatomaceous mud deposited during spring

multiple summer/autumn Chaetoceros spp. diatom oozes
and sporadically present clay-rich winter flood
deposits. Sub-decadal periods have been identified
and linked to the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO)

periods to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation

modem analogues suggests associations may exist
between: early spring Pialassiosira spp. laminae and

S. costatum laminae and El Nino events;
summer/autumn Chaetoceros spp. multiple laminae and

abstract = {Long-term sedimentary sequences provide a wealth of
useful information for research into the
palaeo-environment, especially in relation to past
climate change. Shorter records provide similar
information in many archaeological contexts. However
if such records are to be used to provide precise
timing of events, and more critically the relative
timing between different records, methods are needed
to provide accurate and precise age-depth models for
these sequences. Given the imprecision of individual
calibrated radiocarbon determinations it is
necessary to use the information we have about the
deposition process to refine our chronologies and
also to provide interpolation between dated levels
in any sequence. Even with layer counted
chronologies, the uncertainties are sometimes hard
to quantify. This paper outlines a range of Bayesian
models for deposition which have been implemented in
the computer programme OxCal. These models can be
used to combine information from the sediments
themselves with radiocarbon or other direct dating
information. Such models have the potential to
integrate information between different records and
provide a coherent chronology on which to base
environmental or archaeological research. (C) 2007

Ocean carbon-cycle models used in calculating these scenarios assume that oceanic circulation and biology remain unchanged through time. Here we examine the importance of this assumption by using a coupled atmosphere–ocean model of global warming5 for the period 1765 to 2065. We find a large potential modification to the ocean carbon sink in a vast region of the Southern Ocean where increased rainfall leads to surface freshening and increased stratification6. The increased stratification reduces the downward flux of carbon and the loss of heat to the atmosphere, both of which decrease the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 relative to a constant-climate control scenario. Changes in the formation, transport and cycling of biological material may counteract the reduced uptake, but the response of the biological community to the climate change is difficult to predict on present understanding. Our simulation suggests that such physical and biological changes might already be occurring, and that they could substantially affect the ocean carbon sink over the next few decades.},

interdecadal variations in sea surface temperature
(SST) over the last similar to100 years has been
termed the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation

generated time series of Sr/Ca and oxygen isotopes
(delta(18)O) from South Pacific Porites coral
colonies growing at Rarotonga (1997 to 1726) and
Fiji (1997 to 1780). At both sites skeletal Sr/Ca is
highly correlated with instrumental SST at least
back to similar to1970 and delta(18)O appears to
reflect both SST and South Pacific Convergence Zone
(SPCZ) effects on seawater delta(18)O. Comparison of
our results to a New Caledonia coral delta(18)O
record and to indices of interdecadal Pacific
climate variability demonstrates that these South
Pacific corals have accurately recorded twentieth
century variations in the IPO and SPCZ. The coral
records also indicate that higher amplitude and more
spatially coherent IPO-related variability existed
from 1880 to 1950 with notably poor between-site
correlations in the mid-1800s. These observations
suggest that the spatial IPO pattern in South
Pacific SST was significantly more complex and/or
poorly defined in the mid-1800s compared to that
observed in the twentieth century. Comparison with
North Pacific IPO indices also indicates that the
degree of cross-hemispheric symmetry of interdecadal
oceanographic variability has changed over time with
a lower correlation between the North and South
Pacific in the mid-1800s. This evidence suggests
that the spatial pattern of the IPO at least in the
South Pacific has varied over the last 300 years,
with a major reorganization occurring after similar
to1880 A.D.},

The initial adjustment of the atmospheric circulation is characterized by an out-of-phase relationship between geopotential height anomalies in the lower and upper troposphere localized to the vicinity of the forcing. This initial baroclinic response reaches a maximum amplitude in ∼5–10 days, and persists for 2–3 weeks. Diagnostic results with a linear primitive equation model indicate that this initial response is forced by diabatic heating anomalies in the lower troposphere associated with surface heat flux anomalies generated by the imposed thermal forcing.

abstract = {Recent warming of Northern Hemisphere (NH) land is
well documented and typically greater in
winter/spring than other seasons. Physical
environment responses to warming have been reported,
but not details of large-area temperate growing
season impacts, or consequences for ecosystems and
agriculture. To date, hemispheric-scale measurements
of biospheric changes have been confined to remote
sensing. However, these studies did not provide
detailed data needed for many investigations. Here,
we show that a suite of modeled and derived measures
(produced from daily maximum-minimum temperatures)
linking plant development (phenology) with its basic
climatic drivers provide a reliable and spatially
extensive method for monitoring general impacts of
global warming on the start of the growing
season. Results are consistent with prior smaller
area studies, confirming a nearly universal quicker
onset of early spring warmth (spring indices (SI)
first leaf date, -1.2 days decade(-1)), late spring
warmth (SI first bloom date, -1.0 days decade(-1);
last spring day below 5 degrees C, -1.4 days
decade(-1)), and last spring freeze date (-1.5 days
decade(-1)) across most temperate NH land regions
over the 1955-2002 period. However, dynamics differ
among major continental areas with North American
first leaf and last freeze date changes displaying a
complex spatial relationship. Europe presents a
spatial pattern of change, with western continental
areas showing last freeze dates getting earlier
faster, some central areas having last freeze and
first leaf dates progressing at about the same pace,
while in portions of Northern and Eastern Europe
first leaf dates are getting earlier faster than
last freeze dates. Across East Asia last freeze
dates are getting earlier faster than first leaf
dates.},

Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The number of grid
points is 154 and the reconstructions cover the

automated gridpoint regression method called
"point-by-point regression" was developed and
tested. In so doing, a near-optimal global solution
was found for its implementation. The
reconstructions have been thoroughly tested for
validity using PDSI data not used in regression
modeling. In general, most of the gridpoint
estimates of drought pass the verification tests
used. In addition, the spatial features of drought
in the United States have been faithfully recorded
in the reconstructions even though the method of
reconstruction is not explicitly spatial in its
design. The drought reconstructions show that the
1930s "Dust Bowl" drought was the most severe such
event to strike the United States since 1700. Other
more local droughts are also revealed in the
regional patterns of drought obtained by rotated
principal component analysis. These reconstructions

In addition to the direct effects on climate--for example, on the frequency of heatwaves--this increase in surface temperatures has important consequences for the hydrological cycle, particularly in regions where water supply is currently dominated by melting snow or ice. In a warmer world, less winter precipitation falls as snow and the melting of winter snow occurs earlier in spring. Even without any changes in precipitation intensity, both of these effects lead to a shift in peak river runoff to winter and early spring, away from summer and autumn when demand is highest. Where storage capacities are not sufficient, much of the winter runoff will immediately be lost to the oceans. With more than one-sixth of the Earth's population relying on glaciers and seasonal snow packs for their water supply, the consequences of these hydrological changes for future water availability--predicted with high confidence and already diagnosed in some regions--are likely to be severe.},

abstract = {The leading modes of variability of the
extratropical circulation in both hemispheres are
characterized by deep, zonally symmetric or
"annular" structures, with geopotential height
perturbations of opposing signs in the polar cap
region and in the surrounding zonal ring centered
near 45 degrees latitude. The structure and dynamics
of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) annular mode have
been extensively documented, whereas the existence
of a Northern Hemisphere (NH) mode, herein referred
to as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), has only recently
been recognized. Like the SH mode, the AO can be
defined as the leading empirical orthogonal function
of the sea level pressure field or of the zonally
symmetric geopotential height or zonal wind
fields. In this paper the; structure and seasonality
of the NH and SH modes are compared based on data
from the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research
reanalysis and supplementary datasets. The
structures of the NH and SH annular modes are shown
to be remarkably similar, not only in the zonally
averaged geopotential height and zonal wind fields,
but in the mean meridional circulations as
well. Both exist year-round in the troposphere, but
they amplify with height upward into the
stratosphere during those seasons in which the
strength of the zonal flow is conducive to strong
planetary wave-mean how interaction: midwinter in
the NH and late spring in the SH. During these
"active seasons," the annular modes modulate the
strength of the Lagrangian mean circulation in the
lower stratosphere, total column ozone and
tropopause height over mid- and high latitudes, and
the strength of the trade winds of their respective
hemispheres. The NH mode also contains an embedded
planetary wave signature with expressions in surface
air temperature, precipitation, total column ozone,
and tropopause height. It is argued that the
horizontal temperature advection by the perturbed
zonal-mean zonal wind field in the lower troposphere
is instrumental in forcing this pattern. A
companion paper documents the striking resemblance
between the structure of the annular modes and
observed climate trends over the past few decades.},

One of the benefits hoped to achieve over GEMPAK is to make it easier to use these routines for any meteorological Python application; this means making it easy to pull out the LCL calculation and just use that, or re-use the Skew-T with your own data code. MetPy also prides itself on being well-documented and well-tested, so that on-going maintenance is easily manageable.

The intended audience is that of GEMPAK: researchers, educators, and any one wanting to script up weather analysis. It doesn't even have to be scripting; all python meteorology tools are hoped to be able to benefit from MetPy. Conversely, it's hoped to be the meteorological equivalent of the audience of scipy/scikit-learn/skimage.},

abstract = {The principal patterns of variability of the
extratropical Northern Hemisphere (NH) wintertime
circulation are examined, based on 42 yr of data
from the NCAR-NCEP reanalyses. The two-dimensional
phase space defined by the two leading PCs of the
monthly mean sea level pressure (SLP) field poleward
of 20degreesN is used as a basis for surveying the
structure of the geopotential height and surface air
temperature (SAT) fields. Together these two
patterns account for roughly half the variance of
SLP on interannual time scales and longer, and
virtually all the planetary-scale SLP trends over
the 42-yr period of record. The leading EOF
corresponds to the NH annular mode (NAM), and the
second EOF resembles the Pacific - North America
(PNA) pattern. The leading EOF of the monthly mean
geopotential height field at various levels
throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere is
well represented by linear combinations of these two
SLP patterns, as are the intra-seasonal and
interannual SLP fields, the NAM, the North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO), the PNA pattern, the pattern
corresponding to the North Pacific index (NP), the
cold ocean - warm land (COWL) pattern, the seasaw
between the depths of the Aleutian and Icelandic
lows (AIS), and the leading EOFs of
lower-tropospheric temperature and midtropospheric
wind. The combined influence of these patterns on
temperature and rainfall and other variables can be
represented in terms of compact vectorial plots.
Interesting differences emerge when the EOF analysis
is performed separately on the intraseasonal and
interannual components of the NH SLP field. The
former patterns appear to be hemispherically
trapped, whereas the latter appear to be reflections
of global structures, with ENSO clearly dominating
the structure of interannual EOF2.},

abstract = {Many regions of the world experienced abrupt climate
variability during the last glacial period (75-15
thousand years ago(1,2)). These changes probably
arose from interactions between Northern Hemisphere
ice sheets and circulation in the North Atlantic
Ocean(3), but the rapid and widespread propagation
of these changes requires a large-scale atmospheric
response whose details remain unclear(4-7). Here we
use an oxygen isotope record from a speleothem
collected from the Cave of the Bells, Arizona, USA,
to reconstruct aridity in the southwestern United
States during the last glacial period and
deglaciation. We find that, during this period,
aridity in the southwestern United States and
climate in the North Atlantic region show similar
patterns of variability. Periods of warmth in the
North Atlantic Ocean, such as interstadials and the
Bolling-Allerod warming, correspond to drier
conditions in the southwestern United
States. Conversely, cooler temperatures in the high
latitudes are associated with increased regional
moisture. We propose that interstadial warming of
the North Atlantic Ocean diverted the westerly storm
track northward, perhaps through weakening of the
Aleutian Low, and thereby reduced moisture delivery
to southwestern North America. A similar response to
future warming would exacerbate aridity in this
already very dry region.},

Statistical analyses of observations show that enhanced poleward moisture transport from the North Pacific to the Arctic Ocean contributed to the accelerated SIA decrease during the most recent period. As a consequence, specific humidity in the Arctic Pacific sector significantly increased along with an increase of downward longwave radiation beginning in 2002, which led to a significant acceleration in the decline of SIA in the Arctic Pacific sector. The resulting sea ice loss lead to increased evaporation in the Arctic Ocean resulting in a further increase of the specific humidity in mid-to-late fall, thus acting as a positive feedback to the sea ice loss.

abstract = {A number of studies have attempted to explain the
cause of decadal variability in the tropical Pacific
and explore its possible link to decadal variability
in the midlatitude Pacific. To investigate some of
the current theories of Pacific decadal variability,
a linear, wind-driven model, designed to simulate
only baroclinic wave dynamics, was forced with wind
stress anomalies in the Pacific Ocean basin from
1945 through 1992. An analysis technique designed to
isolate the decadal/interdecadal scale variability
from interannual ENSO variability was performed on
the model's thermocline depth anomaly (TDA). It was
found that the temporal and spatial patterns of the
observed tropical decadal sea surface temperatures
are consistent with our modeled TDA. Furthermore,
restricting the wind forcing to within 58 of the
equator does not substantially alter the
decadal/interdecadal variability of the equatorial
region. The authors conclude that the observed
decadal variability in the low-latitude Pacific is
primarily a linear dynamical response to tropical
wind forcing and does not directly require an
oceanic link to the midlatitudes. The question of
how tropical wind anomalies are generated is not
addressed. In addition, it is shown that in model
scenarios where the wind forcing is restricted to
the western equatorial Pacific, the 1976-77 climate
shift is still clearly visible as a dominant feature
of tropical decadal variability. The temporal
decadal signal of the model-generated TDA is more
pronounced during the eastern equatorial upwelling
season (July-September) than in the boreal
winter. This is consistent with the observed
seasonal bias in tracer and SST data from the
eastern equatorial Pacific.},

abstract = {The decline of Arctic sea ice has been documented in over 30 y of satellite passive microwave observations. The resulting darkening of the Arctic and its amplification of global warming was hypothesized almost 50 y ago but has yet to be verified with direct observations. This study uses satellite radiation budget measurements along with satellite microwave sea ice data to document the Arctic-wide decrease in planetary albedo and its amplifying effect on the warming. The analysis reveals a striking relationship between planetary albedo and sea ice cover, quantities inferred from two independent satellite instruments. We find that the Arctic planetary albedo has decreased from 0.52 to 0.48 between 1979 and 2011, corresponding to an additional 6.4 ± 0.9 W/m(2) of solar energy input into the Arctic Ocean region since 1979. Averaged over the globe, this albedo decrease corresponds to a forcing that is 25{\%} as large as that due to the change in CO2 during this period, considerably larger than expectations from models and other less direct recent estimates. Changes in cloudiness appear to play a negligible role in observed Arctic darkening, thus reducing the possibility of Arctic cloud albedo feedbacks mitigating future Arctic warming.},

abstract = {This article applies formal detection and
attribution techniques to investigate the nature of
observed shifts in the timing of streamflow in the
western United States. Previous studies have shown
that the snow hydrology of the western United States
has changed in the second half of the twentieth
century. Such changes manifest themselves in the
form of more rain and less snow, in reductions in
the snow water contents, and in earlier snowmelt and
associated advances in streamflow ``center'' timing
(the day in the ``water-year'' on average when half
the water-year flow at a point has passed). However,
with one exception over a more limited domain, no
other study has attempted to formally attribute
these changes to anthropogenic increases of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Using the
observations together with a set of global climate
model simulations and a hydrologic model (applied to
three major hydrological regions of the western
United States-the California region, the upper
Colorado River basin, and the Columbia River basin),
it is found that the observed trends toward earlier
``center'' timing of snowmelt-driven streamflows in
the western United States since 1950 are detectably
different from natural variability (significant at
the p {\textless} 0.05 level). Furthermore, the nonnatural
parts of these changes can be attributed confidently
to climate changes induced by anthropogenic
greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, and land use. The
signal from the Columbia dominates the analysis, and
it is the only basin that showed a detectable signal
when the analysis was performed on individual
basins. It should be noted that although climate
change is an important signal, other climatic
processes have also contributed to the hydrologic
variability of large basins in the western United
States.},

This study addresses the question of whether the atmospheric trends may be caused by observed trends in oceanic boundary forcing. Experiments were carried out using the NCAR atmospheric general circulation model with specified sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice anomalies confined to the North Atlantic sector. The spatial pattern of the anomalous forcing was chosen to be realistic in that it corresponds to the recent 40-yr trend in SST and sea ice, but the anomaly amplitude was exaggerated in order to make the response statistically more robust. The wintertime response to both types of forcing resembles the NAO to first order. Even for an exaggerated amplitude, the atmospheric response to the SST anomaly is quite weak compared to the observed positive trend in the NAO, but has the same sign, indicative of a weak ...},

abstract = {To reconstruct oceanographic variations in the
subtropical South Pacific, 271-year long subseasonal
time series of Sr/Ca and delta(18)O were generated
from a coral growing at Rarotonga (21.5degreesS,
159.5degreesW). In this case, coral Sr/Ca appears to
be an excellent proxy for sea surface temperature
(SST) and coral delta(18)O is a function of both SST
and seawater delta(18)O composition
(delta(18)O(sw)). Here, we focus on extracting the
delta(18)O(sw) signal from these proxy records. A
method is presented assuming that coral Sr/Ca is
solely a function of SST and that coral delta(18)O
is a function of both SST and delta(18)O(sw). This
method separates the effects of delta(18)O(sw) from
SST by breaking the instantaneous changes of coral
delta(18)O into separate contributions by
instantaneous SST and delta(18)O(sw) changes,
respectively. The results show that on average
delta(18)O(sw) at Rarotonga explains similar to39{\%}
of the variance in delta(18)O and that variations in
SST explains the remaining similar to61{\%} of
delta(18)O variance. Reconstructed delta(18)O(sw)
shows systematic increases in summer months
(December-February) consistent with the regional
pattern of variations in precipitation and
evaporation. The delta(18)O(sw) also shows a
positive linear correlation with satellite-derived
estimated salinity for the period 1980 to 1997 (r =
0.72). This linear correlation between reconstructed
delta(18)O(sw) and salinity makes it possible to use
the reconstructed delta(18)O(sw) to estimate the
past interannual and decadal salinity changes in
this region. Comparisons of coral delta(18)O and
delta(18)O(sw) at Rarotonga with the Pacific decadal
oscillation index suggest that the decadal and
interdecadal salinity and SST variability at
Rarotonga appears to be related to basin-scale
decadal variability in the Pacific. Copyright (C)

of Holocene stalagmites from four caves in Northern
and Southern Oman and Yemen (Socotra) provide
detailed information on fluctuations in
precipitation along a latitudinal transect from 12
degrees N to 23 degrees N. delta O-18 values reflect
the amount of precipitation which is primarily
controlled by the mean latitudinal position of the
ITCZ and dynamics of the Indian summer monsoon
(ISM). During the early Holocene rapidly decreasing
6180 values indicate a rapid northward displacement
in the mean latitudinal position of the summer ITCZ
and the associated ISM rainfall belt, with decadal-
to centennial-scale changes in monsoon precipitation
correlating well with high-latitude temperature
variations recorded in Greenland ice cores. During
the middle to late Holocene the summer ITCZ
continuously migrated southward and monsoon
precipitation decreased gradually in response to
decreasing solar insolation, a trend, which is also
recorded in other monsoon records from the Indian
and East Asian monsoon domains. Importantly, there
is no evidence for an abrupt middle Holocene
weakening in monsoon precipitation. Although abrupt
monsoon events are apparent in all monsoon records,
they are short-lived and clearly superimposed on the
long-term trend of decreasing monsoon
precipitation. For the late Holocene there is an
anti-correlation between ISM precipitation in Oman
and inter-monsoon (spring/autumn) precipitation on
Socotra, revealing a possible long-term change in
the duration of the summer monsoon season since at
least 4.5 ka BP. Together with the progressive
shortening of the ISM season, gradual southward
retreat of the mean summer ITCZ and weakening of the
ISM, the total amount of precipitation decreased in
those areas located at the northern fringe of the
Indian and Asian monsoon domains, but increased in
areas closer to the equator. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Japanese Reanalysis (JRA-25) temperatures from 1979

30 degrees N to 30 degrees S, with results projected
globally onto various other fields. The first two
empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) both have
primary relationships to El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) but feature rather different
vertical and spatial structures. By construction the
two patterns are orthogonal, but their signatures in
sea level pressure, precipitation, outgoing longwave
radiation (OLR), and tropospheric diabatic heating
are quite similar. Moreover, they are significantly
related, with EOF-2 leading EOF-1 by about 4 -6
months, indicating that they play complementary
roles in the evolution of ENSO events, and with each
mode playing greater or lesser roles in different
events and seasons. The dominant pattern (EOF-1) in
its positive sign features highly coherent zonal
mean warming throughout the tropical troposphere
from 30 degrees N to 30 degrees S that increases in
magnitude with height to 200 hPa, drops to zero
about 100 hPa at the tropopause, and has reverse
sign to 30 hPa with peak values at 70 hPa. It
correlates strongly with global mean surface
temperatures. EOF-2 emphasizes off-equatorial
centers of action and strong Rossby wave temperature
signatures that are coherent throughout the
troposphere, with the strongest values in the
Pacific that extend into the extratropics and a sign
reversal at and above 150 hPa. Near the surface,
both patterns feature boomerang-shaped opposite
temperatures in the western tropical and subtropical
Pacific, with similar sea level pressure patterns,
but with EOF-1 more focused in equatorial
regions. Both patterns are strongest during the
boreal winter half-year when anomalous precipitation
in the tropics and associated latent heating drive
teleconnections throughout the world. For El Nino in
northern winter EOF-1 has more precipitation in the
eastern tropical Pacific, while EOF-2 has much drier
conditions over northern Australia and the Indian
Ocean. In northern summer, the main differences are
in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean. Differences
in teleconnections suggest great sensitivity to
small changes in forcings in association with
seasonal variations in the mean state.},

Bolling-Allerod returned to the central Gulf Between
around 11.0 and 6.2 ka, tropical diatoms and
silicoflagellates were virtually absent from the
central Gulf, as relatively cooler and fresher
surface waters resembling those of the modem
northern Gulf were present in the central
Gulf. Beginning at about 6.2 ka, tropical diatoms
and silicollagellates began increasing in the
central Gulf, and coccoliths returned to western
Gulf sediments. The onset of modem-day monsoon
conditions in the American Southwest required the
presence of warm SSTs in the northern Gulf, which
probably did not occur until after about 5.4 ka,
when tropical diatoms and silicoflagellates became
relatively common in the central Gulf. Modem
east-west contrasts, which arise from late
winter-early spring coastal upwelling on the
mainland side and lower diatom productivity on the
western side of the Gulf, commenced between 6.2 and
5.4 ka, possibly due to a shift in the direction of
late winter-early spring winds more towards the
southeast, or down the axis of the Gulf This
proposed wind shift might have ultimately been due
to a late Holocene strengthening of ENSO-like
conditions in the eastern equatorial
Pacific. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

study is concerned with identifying and removing
from global-mean temperatures the signatures of

based methodologies are developed and applied to
isolate the climate impacts of three known sources
of natural variability: the El Nino-Southern

marine air masses over the high-latitude continents
during winter, and aerosols injected into the
stratosphere by explosive volcanic eruptions. After
the effects of ENSO and high-latitude temperature
advection are removed from the global-mean
temperature record, the signatures of volcanic
eruptions and changes in instrumentation become more
clearly apparent. After the volcanic eruptions are
subsequently filtered from the record, the residual
time series reveals a nearly monotonic global
warming pattern since similar to 1950. The results
also reveal coupling between the land and ocean
areas on the interannual time scale that transcends
the effects of ENSO and volcanic eruptions. Globally
averaged land and ocean temperatures are most
strongly correlated when ocean leads land by; 2-3
months. These coupled fluctuations exhibit a
complicated spatial signature with largest-amplitude
sea surface temperature perturbations over the

of the Southern Oscillation changed from 1882 to
1995 was given by Trenberth and Hoar [1996], with a
focus on the unusual nature of the 1990-1995 El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) warm event in the
context of an observed trend for more EI Nino and
fewer La Nina events after the late 1970s. The
conclusions of that study have been challenged by
two studies which deal with only the part of our
results pertaining to the length of runs of
anomalies of one sign in the Southern Oscillation
Index. They therefore neglect the essence of
Trenberth and Hear, which focussed on the magnitude
of anomalies for certain periods and showed that
anomalies during both the post-1976 and
1990-mid-1995 periods were highly unlikely given the
previous record. With updated data through mid 1997,
we have performed additional tests using a
regression model with autoregressive-moving average
(ARMA) errors that simultaneously estimates the
appropriate ARMA model to fit the data and assesses
the statistical significance of how unusual the two
periods of interest are. The mean SOI for the
post-1976 period is statistically different from the
overall mean at {\textless} 0.05{\%} and so is the 1990-mid-1995
period. The recent evolution of ENSO, with a major
new El Nino event underway in 1997, reinforces the
evidence that the tendency for more El Nino and
fewer La Nina events since the late 1970s is highly
unusual and very unlikely to be accounted for solely
by natural variability.},

abstract = {This study explored possible advantages conferred by
the phase shift between leaf phenology and
photosynthesis seasonality in a semi-arid Pinus
halepensis forest system, not seen in temperate
sites. Leaf-scale measurements of gas exchange,
nitrogen and phenology were used on daily, seasonal
and annual time-scales. Peak photosynthesis was in
late winter, when high soil moisture, mild
temperatures and low leaf vapour pressure deficit
(D-L) allowed high rates associated with high water-
and nitrogen-use efficiencies. Self-sustained new
needle growth through the dry and hot summer
maximized photosynthesis in the following wet
season, without straining carbon storage. Low rates
of water loss were associated with increasing
sensitivity of stomatal conductance (g(s)) to soil
moisture below a relative extractable water (REW) of
0.4, and decreased g(s) sensitivity to D-L below REW
of approx. 0.2. This response was captured by the
modified Ball-Berry (Leuning) model. While most
physiological parameters and responses measured were
typical of temperate pines, the
photosynthesis-phenological phasing contributed to
high productivity under warm-dry conditions. This
contrasts with reported effects of short-term
periodical droughts and could lead to different
predictions of the effect of warming and drying

State-of-the-art global climate models do not capture this characteristic of hydroclimate variability, suggesting that the models underestimate the risk of future persistent droughts. Methods are developed here for assessing the risk of such events in the coming century using climate model projections as well as observational (paleoclimate) information. Where instrumental and paleoclimate data are reliable, these methods may provide a more complete view of prolonged drought risk.

knowledge of past climate dynamics is critical for
assessing present and future constraints on the
region's dwindling freshwater resources. We present
initial results from two drill cores extracted from
the present-day edge of Lake Elsinore, southern
California's largest natural lake. Using a
multiproxy approach including lithologic
description, mass magnetic susceptibility, LOI 550
degrees C (total organic matter), and LOI 950
degrees C (total carbonate), we infer first-order,
long-term climate change over the past 19 250
calendar years. Furthermore, we suggest possible
first-order forcing mechanisms that drive this
change, which include presence/absence of
continental ice sheets, insolation, and complex
ocean-atmosphere interactions. Our results indicate
four distinct millennial-scale climate modes over
the past 19 250 calendar years. These modes include
a wet Last Glacial Maximum (19 250-17 120 cal. yr
BP), a relatively dry late-Glacial/Holocene
transition (17120-9450 cal. yr BP), a wet early
Holocene (9450-7670 cal. yr BP), and a highly
variable mid-to-late Holocene climate (i.e.,
alternating wet/dry cycles; 7670 cal. yr
BP-present). We attribute the mid-to-late Holocene
climate interval to the onset of El Nino-Southern
Oscillation ca. 7000 cal. yr BP and a more vigorous
hydrologic system. These results are supported by a
variety of regional terrestrial and marine

We describe a new technique designed to process radar echograms from the University of Kansas snow radar to estimate snow depth. We combine IceBridge laser altimetry with radar-derived snow depths to determine sea ice thickness. Results are validated through comparison with direct measurements of snow and ice thickness collected in situ at the Danish GreenArc 2009 sea ice camp located on fast ice north of Greenland. The IceBridge instrument suite provides accurate measurements of snow and ice thickness, particularly over level ice. Mean IceBridge snow and ice thickness agree with in situ measurements to within {\~{}} 0.01 and {\~{}} 0.05 m, respectively, while modal snow and ice thickness estimates agree to within 0.02 and 0.10 m, respectively. IceBridge snow depths were correlated with in situ measurements (R = 0.7, for an averaging length of 55 m). The uncertainty associated with the derived IceBridge sea ice thickness estimates is 0.40 m. The results demonstrate the retrieval of both first-year and multiyear ice thickness from IceBridge data. The airborne data were however compromised in heavily ridged ice where snow depth, and hence ice thickness, could not be measured. Techniques developed as part of this study will be used for routine processing of IceBridge retrievals over Arctic sea ice. The limitations of the GreenArc study are discussed, and recommendations for future validation of airborne measurements via field activities are provided.},

precipitation records to better understand long-term
climate dynamics. Here, we use the multi-taper
method of spectral analysis to analyze the monthly
precipitation time series (both occurrence and
amount) at a few stations along a meridional
transect from Priest River, ID to Tucson, AZ. We
also examine spectral coherence between monthly
precipitation and widely used atmospheric indices,
such as the central Northern Pacific (CNP) and
southern oscillation index (SOI). This analysis
reveals statistically significant `signals' in the
time series in the 5-7 and 2-3 year bands. These
interannual signals are consistent with those
related to El-Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) and
quasi-biennial variability identified by others. (C)

abstract = {Pacific Ocean sea surface height trends from
satellite altimeter observations for 1993-2009 are
examined in the context of longer tide gauge records
and wind stress patterns. The dominant regional
trends are high rates in the western tropical
Pacific and minimal to negative rates in the eastern
Pacific, particularly off North America. Interannual
sea level variations associated with El
Nino-Southern Oscillation events do not account for
these trends. In the western tropical Pacific, tide
gauge records indicate that the recent high rates
represent a significant trend increase in the early
1990s relative to the preceding 40 years. This sea
level trend shift in the western Pacific corresponds
to an intensification of the easterly trade winds
across the tropical Pacific. The wind change appears
to be distinct from climate variations centered in
the North Pacific, such as the Pacific decadal
oscillation. In the eastern Pacific, tide gauge
records exhibit higher-amplitude decadal
fluctuations than in the western tropical Pacific,
and the recent negative sea level trends are
indistinguishable from these fluctuations. The
shifts in trade wind strength and western Pacific
sea level rate resemble changes in dominant global
modes of outgoing longwave radiation and sea surface
temperature. It is speculated that the western
Pacific sea level response indicates a general
strengthening of the atmospheric circulation over
the tropical Pacific since the early 1990s that has
developed in concert with recent warming trends.},

abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of
scientific interest and have significant
consequences for our understanding of natural and
man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and
characterization of power laws is complicated by the
large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the
distribution-the part of the distribution
representing large but rare events-and by the
difficulty of identifying the range over which
power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for
analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares
fitting, can produce Substantially inaccurate
estimates of parameters for power-law distributions,
and even in cases where such methods return accurate
answers they are still unsatisfactory because they
give no indication of whether the data obey a power
law at all. Here we present a principled statistical
framework for discerning and quantifying power-law
behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines
maximum-likelihood fitting methods with
goodness-of-fit tests based on the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood
ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
approach with tests on synthetic data, and give
critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also
apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world
data sets from a range of different disciplines,
each of which has been conjectured to follow a
power-law distribution. In some cases we find these
conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in
others the power law is ruled out.},

abstract = {The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) has been
widely used to study aridity changes in modern and
past climates. Efforts to address its major problems
have led to new variants of the PDSI, such as the
self-calibrating PDSI (sc{\_}PDSI) and PDSI using
improved formulations for potential
evapotranspiration (PE), such as the Penman-Monteith
equation (PE{\_}pm) instead of the Thornthwaite
equation (PE{\_}th). Here I compare and evaluate four
forms of the PDSI, namely, the PDSI with PE{\_}th
(PDSI{\_}th) and PE{\_}pm (PDSI{\_}pm) and the sc{\_}PDSI with
PE{\_}th (sc{\_}PDSI{\_}th) and PE{\_}pm (sc{\_}PDSI{\_}pm) calculated
using available climate data from 1850 to 2008. Our
results confirm previous findings that the choice of
the PE only has small effects on both the PDSI and
sc{\_}PDSI for the 20th century climate, and the
self-calibration reduces the value range slightly
and makes the sc{\_}PDSI more comparable spatially than
the original PDSI. However, the histograms of the
sc{\_}PDSI are still non-Gaussian at many locations,
and all four forms of the PDSI show similar
correlations with observed monthly soil moisture (r
= 0.4-0.8) in North America and Eurasia, with
historical yearly streamflow data (r = 0.4-0.9) over
most of the world's largest river basins, and with
GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment)
satellite-observed water storage changes (r =
0.4-0.8) over most land areas. All the four forms of
the PDSI show widespread drying over Africa, East
and South Asia, and other areas from 1950 to 2008,
and most of this drying is due to recent
warming. The global percentage of dry areas has
increased by about 1.74{\%} (of global land area) per
decade from 1950 to 2008. The use of the
Penman-Monteith PE and self-calibrating PDSI only
slightly reduces the drying trend seen in the
original PDSI. The percentages of dry and wet areas
over the global land area and six select regions are
anticorrelated (r = -0.5 to -0.7), but their
long-term trends during the 20th century do not
cancel each other, with the trend for the dry area
often predominating over that for the wet area,
resulting in upward trends during the 20th century
for the areas under extreme (i.e., dry or wet)
conditions for the global land as a whole (similar
to 1.27{\%} per decade) and the United States, western
Europe, Australia, Sahel, East Asia, and southern
Africa. The recent drying trends are qualitatively
consistent with other analyses and model
predictions, which suggest more severe drying in the
coming decades.},

abstract = {[1] In the South Pacific, interdecadal-decadal
oceanic and atmospheric variability, referred to as
the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), is most
pronounced in the South Pacific Convergence Zone
(SPCZ) salinity front region. Here we have used
annual average oxygen isotope (delta O-18) time
series from five coral cores collected from Fiji and
Tonga in this region to construct a Fiji-Tonga
Interdecadal-Decadal Pacific Oscillation (F-T IDPO)
index of low-frequency ({\textgreater} 9 and {\textless} 55 years) climate
variability back to 1650 A. D. We first demonstrate
the consistency between this F-T IDPO index and a
mean sea level (MSL) pressure-based SPCZ position
index (SPI) (1891-2000), thus verifying the ability
of coral delta O-18 to record past
interdecadal-decadal climatic variations in this
region back to 1891. The F-T IDPO index is then
shown to be synchronous with the IPO index
(1856-2000), suggesting that this coral-based index
effectively represents the interdecadal-decadal
scale climate variance back to 1650. The regularity
of the F-T IDPO index indicates that
interdecadal-decadal variability in the SPCZ region
has been relatively constant over the past 350 years
with a mean frequency of similar to 20 years
(variance peaks near 11 and 35 years). There is a
consistent antiphase correlation of the F-T IDPO
index and the interdecadal-decadal components in
equatorial Pacific coral delta O-18 series from
Maiana and Palmyra. This observation indicates that
the eastward expansion (westward contraction) of the
eastern salinity front of the Western Pacific Warm
Pool (WPWP) occurs simultaneously (+/-{\textless}= 1 year)
with the westward (eastward) shift of the SPCZ
salinity front during positive IPO (negative IPO)
phases. This is the same relationship observed
during the phases of the El Nino Southern
Oscillation.},

abstract = {Water resource management requires knowledge of the
natural variability in streamflow over multiple time
scales. Reconstructions of streamflow derived from
moisture-sensitive trees extend, in both time and
magnitude, the variability provided by relatively
short gage records. In this study, we present a
network of 14 annual streamflow reconstructions,
300-600 years long, for gages in the Upper Colorado
and South Platte River basins in Colorado generated
from new and existing tree-ring chronologies. Gages
for the reconstruction were selected on the basis of
their importance to two of the largest Colorado
Front Range water providers, who provided the
natural flow data for the calibration with tree-ring
data. The reconstruction models explain 63-76{\%} of
the variance in the gage records and capture low
flows particularly well. Analyses of the
reconstructions indicate that the 20th century gage
record does not fully represent the range of
streamflow characteristics seen in the prior two to
five centuries. Multi-year drought events more
severe than the 1950s drought have occurred, notably
in the 19th century, and the distribution of extreme
low flow years is markedly uneven over the past
three centuries. When the 14 reconstructions are
grouped into Upper Colorado, northern South Platte,
and southern South Platte regional flow
reconstructions, the three time series show a high
degree of coherence, but also time-varying
divergences that may reflect the differential
influence of climatic features operating in the
western U.S. These reconstructions are currently
being used by water managers to assess the
reliability of water supply systems under a broader

Standardization (RCS) method was employed to
maximize potential low-frequency information in this

persistent above-average growth around the time of
the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) early in the

the annual delta(18)O variations reflect those in

record shows a secular warming trend and a 35-year
oscillation in temperatures over the last 137
years. A trend and a 34-year cycle are also found in
the delta(13)C record. The latter trend may be
caused by either anthropogenic effects or a
cloud-cover increase in this region of the Pacific
Ocean, while the interdecadal oscillation appears to
be related to changes in cloud cover, as well as in

abstract = {[1] We compare the CMIP3 model fields with observations of sea ice motion, export, extent, and thickness and analyze fields of sea level pressure and geostrophic wind of the Arctic Ocean. These variables play important roles in the distribution and annual balance of sea ice volume within the basin. While it is not expected that uninitialized simulations agree completely with observations, these assessments serve to summarize ensemble behavior, as baselines for measuring improvements, and to evaluate reliability of CMIP3 simulations (and potentially CMIP5) for projection of decline rates of Arctic sea ice coverage. We find the model‐data differences and intermodel scatter in summarizing statistics are large. In a majority of model fields the mean high‐pressure pattern in the southern Beaufort is significantly displaced toward the central Arctic Basin, leading to difficulties in reproducing the mean spatial patterns of sea ice circulation, thickness, and ice export. Thus, even though the CMIP3 multimodel data set agrees that increased greenhouse gas concentrations will result in reductions of Arctic sea ice area and volume, these comparisons suggest considerable uncertainties in the projected rates of sea ice decline.},

These leads can be observed in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images under predominantly clear sky conditions. Sea ice concentrations (SIC) derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) using the Bootstrap (BST) algorithm fail to show the lead occurrences, as is visible in the MODIS images. In contrast, SIC derived from AMSR2 using the Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study (ARTIST) sea ice algorithm (ASI) reveal the lead structure, due to the higher spatial resolution possible when using 89-GHz channel data. The ASI SIC are calculated from brightness temperatures interpolated on three different grids with resolutions of 3.125 km (ASI-3k), 6.25 km (ASI-6k) and 12.5 km (ASI-12k) to investigate the effect of the spatial resolution. Single-swath data is used to study the effect of temporal sampling in comparison to daily averages. For a region of interest in the Beaufort Sea, BST and ASI-3k show area-averaged SIC of 97{\%}±0.7{\%} and 93{\%}±7.0{\%}, respectively. For ASI-6k, the area-averaged SIC are similar to ASI-3k, while ASI-12k data show more agreement with BST. Visual comparison with MODIS True Color imagery exhibits good agreement with ASI-3k. In particular, ASI-3k are able to reproduce lead structure and size in the sea ice cover, which are not or are less visible in the other SIC data. The results will be valuable for selecting a SIC data product for studies of the interaction between ocean, ice, and atmosphere in the polar regions.},

We also show that climate filtering conducted by individual trees creates major regional differences in information that may be recovered from the hemispheric network. This behavior can introduce geographic biases to dendroclimatic reconstructions, but it also may be useful to evaluate the success of reconstruction techniques that explicitly represent the physical processes linking climate to tree growth.},

abstract = {Today, the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
system is the primary driver of interannual
variability in global climate, but its long-term
behaviour is poorly understood. Instrumental
observations reveal a shift in 1976 towards warmer
and wetter conditions in the tropical Pacific, with
widespread climatic and ecological
consequences(1-3). This shift, unique over the past
century(4), has prompted debate over the influence
of increasing atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases on ENSO variability(5-7). Here we
present a 155-year ENSO reconstruction from a
central tropical Pacific coral that provides new
evidence for long-term changes in the regional mean
climate and its variability. A gradual transition in
the early twentieth century and the abrupt change in
1976, both towards warmer and wetter conditions,
co-occur with changes in variability. In the
mid-late nineteenth century, cooler and drier
background conditions coincided with prominent
decadal variability; in the early twentieth century,
shorter-period (similar to2.9 years) variability
intensified. After 1920, variability weakens and
becomes focused at interannual timescales; with the
shift in 1976, variability with a period of about 4
years becomes prominent. Our results suggest that
variability in the tropical Pacific is linked to the
region's mean climate, and that changes in both have
occurred during periods of natural as well as
anthropogenic climate forcing.},

abstract = {Southern California and much of the western United
States face a chronic challenge of limited water
supply due to high potential evaporation and low
precipitation coupled with frequent
droughts. Mitigation approaches include the use of
ground water, reliance on water from river systems
fed by mountainous regions that have relatively high
precipitation, and the construction of extensive
aqueduct and water storage systems. In southern
California the present infrastructure is capable of
insulating large water districts against the typical
annual and multi-annual droughts experienced over
the past 100 years. However, paleoclimatic records
indicate that the region is also prone to much
longer droughts, including a prolonged episode of
generally and conditions and severe droughts
extending from the 9th through 14th centuries. This
period is sometimes referred to as the medieval
climate anomaly. Archaeological evidence suggests
that prehistoric populations such as the Anasazi in
the Southwest and the Chumash in southern California
were impacted by mega-drought conditions during the
medieval climate anomaly. These groups appear to
have displayed a variety of responses-ranging from
increased violence and the abandonment of some
regions, to the development of greater cultural
complexity and material
infrastructure. Paleoclimatological and
paleooceanographic data indicate that the and
conditions in western North America during the
medieval climate anomaly were produced by the
prolonged occurrence of cool surface waters in the
eastern Pacific. Recent climate model experiments
suggest relatively small increases in insolation and
decreases in atmospheric volcanic emission
concentrations can trigger such depressions of
eastern Pacific temperatures. It is thus possible
that a similar event could occur in the future due
to natural or anthropogenic causes. (c) 2007

Based on the approach he developed in his class at Harvard, Jacob introduces students in clear and concise chapters to the fundamentals as well as the latest ideas and findings in the field. Jacob's aim is to show students how to use basic principles of physics and chemistry to describe a complex system such as the atmosphere. He also seeks to give students an overview of the current state of research and the work that led to this point. Jacob begins with atmospheric structure, design of simple models, atmospheric transport, and the continuity equation, and continues with geochemical cycles, the greenhouse effect, aerosols, stratospheric ozone, the oxidizing power of the atmosphere, smog, and acid rain. Each chapter concludes with a problem set based on recent scientific literature. This is a novel approach to problem-set writing, and one that successfully introduces students to the prevailing issues. This is a major contribution to a growing area of study and will be welcomed enthusiastically by students and teachers alike.},

each climate division in Arizona and New Mexico from
a network of 19 tree-ring chronologies in the
southwestern USA. Linear regression (LR) and
artificial neural network (NN) models were used to
identify the cool-season precipitation signal in
tree rings. Using 1931-88 records, the stepwise LR
model was cross-validated with a leave-one-out
procedure and the NN was validated with a bootstrap
technique. The final models were also independently
validated using the 1896-1930 precipitation data. In
most of the climate divisions, both techniques can
successfully reconstruct dry and normal years, and
the NN seems to capture large precipitation events
and more variability better than the LR. In the 1000
year reconstructions. the NN also produces more
distinctive wet events and more variability, whereas
the LR produces more distinctive dry events. The
1000 year reconstructed precipitation from the two
models shows several sustained dry and wet periods
comparable to the 1950s drought (e.g. 16th century
mega drought) and to the post-1976 wet period (e.g.
1330s, 1610s). The impact of extreme periods on the
environment may be stronger during sudden reversals
from dry to wet, which were not uncommon throughout
the millennium, such as the 1610s wet interval that
followed the 16th century mega drought. The
instrumental records suggest that strong dry to wet
precipitation reversals in the past 1000 years might
be linked to strong shifts from cold to warm El
Nino-southern oscillation events And from a negative
to positive Pacific decadal oscillation. Copyright

exhibits a highly statistically significant
interdecadal component vet contains little to no

residual variability of the Pacific's leading SST

correlated with El Nino anomalies. This indicates
that by simply including an atmospheric component,

decomposed into its interdecadal and interannual
patterns. Although the interdecadal signal is
unrelated to interannual El Nino variability. the
interdecadal ocean-atmosphere variability still

scientific objectives of NAME are to promote a
better understanding and more realistic simulation
of warm-season convective processes in complex
terrain, intraseasonal variability of the monsoon,
and the response of the warm-season atmospheric
circulation and precipitation patterns to slowly
varying, potentially predictable surface boundary
conditions. During the summer of 2004, the NAME
community implemented an international (United
States, Mexico, Central America), multiagency (NOAA,
NASA, NSF, USDA) field experiment called NAME
2004. This article presents early results from the
NAME 2004 campaign and describes how the NAME
modeling community will leverage the NAME 2004 data
to accelerate improvements in warm-season

suggest periods of multiple decades when droughts

when drought was more persistent than in the 20th
century, Both the Medieval Period and Little Ice Age
were hydrologically complex, and there is no clear
evidence to suggest that either interval was
coherent or unusual in effective moisture relative
to long-term patterns. Differences among the three

Seasonal and regional maps and histograms of these properties were constructed. The majority of the data were obtained from submarines equipped with a narrow-beam, upward-looking sonar. As determined from an analysis of 17 submarine cruises, the overall mean thickness of Arctic sea ice above 65° N, including both deformed and undeformed ice, is 2.9 m with a standard deviation of 1.8 m. The overall seasonal mean ranges from approximately 2.4 m in spring to 3.3 m in summer. Local mean ice drafts ranged from less than 1 m near the marginal ice zone to greater than 7 m to the north of the Canadian Archipelago. Histograms of sea ice draft reflect a bimodal distribution in winter and spring, an effect of the presence of thin first year ice. Due to ice melt in summer and autumn only a single mode of much thicker multiyear ice is observed.},

abstract = {The controversial claim that El Ni (n) over tildeo
events might be partially caused by radiative
forcing due to volcanic aerosols is
reassessed. Building on the work of Mann et al.,
estimates of volcanic forcing over the past
millennium and a climate model of intermediate
complexity are used to draw a diagram of El Ni (n)
over tildeo likelihood as a function of the
intensity of volcanic forcing. It is shown that in
the context of this model, only eruptions larger
than that of Mt. Pinatubo ( 1991, peak dimming of
about 3.7Wm(-2)) can shift the likelihood and
amplitude of an El Ni (n) over tildeo event above
the level of the model's internal
variability. Explosive volcanism cannot be said to
trigger El Ni (n) over tildeo events per se, but it
is found to raise their likelihood by 50{\%} on
average, also favoring higher amplitudes. This
reconciles, on one hand, the demonstration by Adams
et al. of a statistical relationship between
explosive volcanism and El Ni (n) over tildeo and,
on the other hand, the ability to predict El Ni (n)
over tildeo events of the last 148 yr without
knowledge of volcanic forcing. The authors then
focus on the strongest eruption of the millennium
(A. D. 1258), and show that it is likely to have
favored the occurrence of a moderate-to-strong El Ni
(n) over tildeo event in the midst of prevailing La
Ni (n) over tildea-like conditions induced by
increased solar activity during the well-documented
Medieval Climate Anomaly. Compiling paleoclimate
data from a wide array of sources, a number of
important hydroclimatic consequences for neighboring
areas is documented. The authors propose, in
particular, that the event briefly interrupted a
solar-induced megadrought in the southwestern United
States. Most of the time, however, volcanic
eruptions are found to be too small to significantly
affect ENSO statistics.},

the global ocean, and also separately in the
tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, are compared
with an ensemble begun in January 1929 with modeled
atmosphere and land initial conditions and
integrated through the 1930s with climatological
SSTs. The ensemble with climatological SSTs produces
values for the precipitation averaged over 1932-39
that are not statistically different from model
climatology. In contrast, the ensembles with global
SST forcing produce a drought centered in the
central plains and southwestern North America that
is clearly separated from the model
climatology. Both the tropical Pacific and northern
tropical Atlantic SST anomalies produce a
statistically significant model drought in this
region. The modeled drought has a spatial pattern
that is different from the observed drought, which
was instead centered in the central and northern
plains and also impacted the northern Rocky Mountain
states but not northeastern Mexico. The model error
in extending the Dust Bowl drought too far south is
attributed to an incorrect response of the model to
warm subtropical North Atlantic SST anomalies. The
model error in the northern states cannot be
attributed to an incorrect response to tropical SST
anomalies. The model also fails to reproduce the
strong surface air warming across most of the
continent during the 1930s. In contrast, the modeled
patterns of precipitation reduction and surface air
temperature warming during the 1950s drought are
more realistic. Tree-ring records show that the Dust
Bowl pattern of drought has occurred before,
suggesting that while the extensive human-induced
land surface degradation and dust aerosol loading of
the 1930s drought may have played an important role
in generating the observed drought pattern, natural
processes, possibly including land interactions, are
capable of generating droughts centered to the north
of the main ENSO teleconnection region. Despite this
caveat, advance knowledge of tropical SSTs alone
would have allowed a high-confidence prediction of a
multiyear and severe drought, but one centered too
far south and without strong cross-continental
warming.},

abstract = {[1] Three prominent quasi-global patterns of
variability and change are observed using the Met
Office's sea surface temperature (SST) analysis and
almost independent night marine air temperature
analysis. The first is a global warming signal that
is very highly correlated with global mean SST. The
second is a decadal to multidecadal fluctuation with
some geographical similarity to the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO). It is associated with the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and its
Pacific-wide manifestation has been termed the
Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). We present
model investigations of the relationship between the
IPO and ENSO. The third mode is an interhemispheric
variation on multidecadal timescales which, in view
of climate model experiments, is likely to be at
least partly due to natural variations in the
thermohaline circulation. Observed climatic impacts
of this mode also appear in model
simulations. Smaller-scale, regional atmospheric
phenomena also affect climate on decadal to
interdecadal timescales. We concentrate on one such
mode, the winter North Atlantic Oscillation
(NAO). This shows strong decadal to interdecadal
variability and a correspondingly strong influence
on surface climate variability which is largely
additional to the effects of recent regional
anthropogenic climate change. The winter NAO is
likely influenced by both SST forcing and
stratospheric variability. A full understanding of
decadal changes in the NAO and European winter
climate may require a detailed representation of the
stratosphere that is hitherto missing in the major

Accurate CryoSat-2 range measurements over open water and the ice surface of the order of centimetres are necessary to achieve the required accuracy of the freeboard-to-thickness conversion. Besides uncertainties of the actual sea-surface height and limited knowledge of ice and snow properties, the composition of radar backscatter and therefore the interpretation of radar echoes is crucial. This has consequences in the selection of retracker algorithms which are used to track the main scattering horizon and assign a range estimate to each CryoSat-2 measurement. In this study we apply a retracker algorithm with thresholds of 40, 50 and 80{\%} of the first maximum of radar echo power, spanning the range of values used in the current literature. By using the selected retrackers and additionally results from airborne validation measurements, we evaluate the uncertainties of sea-ice freeboard and higher-level products that arise from the choice of the retracker threshold only, independent of the uncertainties related to snow and ice properties. Our study shows that the choice of retracker thresholds does have a significant impact on magnitudes of estimates of sea-ice freeboard and thickness, but that the spatial distributions of these parameters are less affected. Specifically we find mean radar freeboard values of 0.121 m (0.265 m) for the 40{\%} threshold, 0.086 m (0.203 m) for the 50{\%} threshold and 0.024 m (0.092 m) for the 80{\%} threshold, considering first-year ice (multiyear ice) in March 2013. We show that the main source of freeboard and thickness uncertainty results from the choice of the retracker and the unknown penetration of the radar pulse into the snow layer in conjunction with surface roughness effects. These uncertainties can cause a freeboard bias of roughly 0.06–0.12 m. Furthermore we obtain a significant rise of 0.02–0.15 m of freeboard from March 2013 to November 2013 in the area for multiyear sea ice north of Greenland and Canada. Since this is unlikely, it gives rise to the assumption that applying different retracker thresholds depending on seasonal properties of the snow load is necessary in the future.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Because of a lack of observations, historical
simulations of land surface conditions using land
surface models are needed for studying variability
and changes in the continental water cycle and for
providing initial conditions for seasonal climate
predictions. Atmospheric forcing datasets are also
needed for land surface model development. The
quality of atmospheric forcing data greatly affects
the ability of land surface models to realistically
simulate land surface conditions. Here a carefully
constructed global forcing dataset for 1948-2004
with 3-hourly and T62 (similar to 1.875 degrees)
resolution is described, and historical simulations
using the latest version of the Community Land Model
version 3.0 (CLM3) are evaluated using available
observations of streamflow, continental freshwater
discharge, surface runoff, and soil moisture. The
forcing dataset was derived by combining
observation-based analyses of monthly precipitation
and surface air temperature with intramonthly
variations from the National Centers for
Environmental Prediction-National Center for
Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis, which
is shown to have spurious trends and biases in
surface temperature and precipitation. Surface
downward solar radiation from the reanalysis was
first adjusted for variations and trends using
monthly station records of cloud cover anomaly and
then for mean biases using satellite observations
during recent decades. Surface specific humidity
from the reanalysis was adjusted using the adjusted
surface air temperature and reanalysis relative
humidity. Surface wind speed and air pressure were
interpolated directly from the 6-hourly reanalysis
data. Sensitivity experiments show that the
precipitation adjustment (to the reanalysis data)
leads to the largest improvement, while the
temperature and radiation adjustments have only
small effects. When forced by this dataset, the CLM3
reproduces many aspects of the long-term mean,
annual cycle, interannual and decadal variations,
and trends of streamflow for many large rivers
(e.g., the Orinoco, Changjiang, Mississippi, etc.),
although substantial biases exist. The simulated
long-term-mean freshwater discharge into the global
and individual oceans is comparable to 921
river-based observational estimates. Observed soil
moisture variations over Illinois and parts of
Eurasia are generally simulated well, with the
dominant influence coming from precipitation. The
results suggest that the CLM3 simulations are useful
for climate change analysis. It is also shown that
unrealistically low intensity and high frequency of
precipitation, as in most model-simulated
precipitation or observed time-averaged fields,
result in too much evaporation and too little
runoff, which leads to lower than observed river
flows. This problem can be reduced by adjusting the
precipitation rates using observed-precipitation
frequency maps.},

confirm the literature regression of delta(18)O

is generally well represented by individual coral
time series, observed decadal and secular
variability does not always display a linear
relationship to local SST anomaly. Instead, many
records appear to better recover nonlocal,
large-scale phenomena, which in turn are related to
either the coral local SST or SST covariant changes
in seawater delta(18)O. We employ empirical
orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to identify
common patterns of variability in the coral data. We
find two significant patterns which are
interpretable as the oceanographic signature of the
El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and as a
near-global warming in which the eastern equatorial
Pacific cools. A third pattern weakly resembles the
Pacific Decadal Oscillation. These modes are seen
more clearly in a singular Vector decomposition
(SVD) of the covariance between the coral data and
the dominant patterns of large-scale historical SST
variability. The results are consistent with those
found in EOF and SVD analyses of SST data from the
coral locations. As additional coral-based proxy
estimates become available, they will improve the
resolution of the patterns recovered. These results
suggest that a sparse network of coral data may be
used to reconstruct interannual, secular, and
decadal SST variability for preinstrumental periods,
albeit with large uncertainty.},

investigated using the Zebiak-Cane coupled

SST pattern is established for which the
area-averaged temperature change is smaller in

balanced almost equally by a change in the heat flux
out of the ocean and by vertical advection of heat
in the ocean through anomalous equatorial ocean
upwelling. The generation of anomalous upwelling is
identified here as a possible mechanism capable of
regulating tropical SSTs. This ocean dynamical
thermostat mechanism has a seasonally varying
efficiency that causes amplification (weakening) of
the seasonal cycle for the heating (cooling). The
interannual variability also changes under the
imposed forcing. These results suggest that the role
of ocean dynamics should be included in any

abstract = {Consistent satellite image time series are increasingly accessible to geoscientists, allowing an effective monitoring of environmental phenomena. Specifically, the use of vegetation index time series has pushed forward the monitoring of large-scale vegetation phenology. Most of these studies derive key phenological metrics from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series on a per-pixel basis. This paper demonstrates an approach to analyze synoptic spatiotemporal phenological patterns over large areas, rather than per pixel. The selected approach involves data mining using a self-organizing map (SOM) and Sammon's projection. To illustrate our approach, we trained a SOM using 13 years of ten-day NDVI composites from the Syst{\`{e}}me Pour l'Observation de la Terre-VEGETATION over the Kruger National Park, South Africa. This resulted in a topologically ordered set of phenological synoptic states. The Sammon's projection was then used to create a simplified representation of the trained SOM that reflects the similarities among the synoptic states. Subsequently, we depicted phenological trajectories for each vegetation season to show how phenological development changes between years. This time series data mining approach provides a holistic characterization of the main regional phenological dynamics and effectively summarizes the information present in the time series, thus facilitating further interpretation.},

The phase of the QBO had little effect on the results in the weak wave (100 m) cases, which did not produce warmings, and the strong wave (400 m) cases, which produced major sudden warmings. At intermediate forcing amplitudes (particularly around 250 m), large wave amplitudes and stratospheric warmings occurred in both westerly and easterly QBO simulations.

the time-averaged intensify tau of the Pacific trade
winds, the mean depth (H) of the thermocline, and
the temperature difference across the thermocline

coupled ocean-atmosphere model indicates two
distinct families of unstable modes. One has long
periods of several years, involves sea surface
temperature variations determined by vertical
movements of the thermocline that are part of the
adjustment of the ocean basin to the fluctuating
winds, requires a relatively deep thermocline, and
corresponds to the delayed oscillator. The other
family requires a shallow thermocline, has short
periods of a year or two, has sea surface
temperature variations determined by advection and
by entrainment across the thermocline, and is
associated with westward phase propagation. For the
modes to be unstable, both families require that the
background zonal wind exceed a certain intensity. An
increase in DeltaT, and in H beyond a certain value,
are stabilizing. For intermediate values of H,

States have been observed since the mid-twentieth
century. These include a reduction in the amount of
precipitation arriving as snow, a decline in
snowpack at low and midelevations, and a shift
toward earlier arrival of both snowmelt and the
centroid (center of mass) of streamflows. To project
future water supply reliability, it is crucial to
obtain a better understanding of the underlying
cause or causes for these changes. A regional
warming is often posited as the cause of these
changes without formal testing of different
competitive explanations for the warming. In this
study, a rigorous detection and attribution analysis
is performed to determine the causes of the late
winter/early spring changes in hydrologically
relevant temperature variables over mountain ranges
of the western United States. Natural internal
climate variability, as estimated from two long
control climate model simulations, is insufficient
to explain the rapid increase in daily minimum and
maximum temperatures, the sharp decline in frost
days, and the rise in degree-days above 0 degrees C
(a simple proxy for temperature-driven
snowmelt). These observed changes are also
inconsistent with the model-predicted responses to
variability in solar irradiance and volcanic
activity. The observations are consistent with
climate simulations that include the combined
effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and
aerosols. It is found that, for each temperature
variable considered, an anthropogenic signal is
identifiable in observational fields. The results
are robust to uncertainties in model-estimated
fingerprints and natural variability noise, to the
choice of statistical down-scaling method, and to

throughout midlatitude spring. Many weather
variables are modified during this season, including
the diurnal temperature range (DTR). The mean DTR
trend displays a discontinuity at the onset of
spring characterized by a rapid increase for several
weeks, followed by an abrupt leveling off. The trend
then remains essentially flat throughout the

reflect the interactive role many weather variables
play with surface-layer processes. Thus, diagnosing
the causes of these variations may provide
background information for numerous global change
analyses, as daily temperature data become
increasingly available worldwide. The results of
this study suggest that several factors (snow cover
loss, more frequent southerly winds, and increased
ceiling heights) are responsible for the initial
rapid increase in the DTR. The second half of the
discontinuity (subsequent leveling off) is connected
with increased atmospheric moisture and coincides
with the onset of plant transpiration.},

@inproceedings{Peacock1998,
abstract = {The use of altimeter data in the polar regions has previously been limited by the presence of permanent and seasonal ice cover. Changes in the radar echo shape received by the altimeter over sea ice, as compared with the open ocean, cause problems in the on-board estimates of surface height, making the data unusable. The majority of noise on the signal can be reduced by retracking the full waveform data set (WAP). Careful quality control is applied to ensure that only those return echoes from which accurate height measurements can be obtained are retained. Consideration of possible backscattering mechanisms from ice and water, and comparisons with imagery, suggest that the specular waveforms typically found in altimeter data over sea ice originate from regions of open water or new thin ice exposed within the altimeter footprint. However, diffuse waveforms similar to those found in ice free seas have been observed in areas of consolidated ice, and may be used to measure ice freeboard. Until recently, even retracked heights contained substantial residual errors due to the interaction of the on-board tracking system with the complex return echoes over sea ice. Software simulation of the tracking system has led to the development of new ground processing algorithms, which further reduce the short wavelength ({\~{}}26 km) noise, from 30-50 cm to around 7 cm. This provides, for the first time in ice covered seas, the capability for accurate mean sea surface generation, measurement of tidal and oceanographic signals and determination of sea ice freeboard. The authors present the results of comparisons of sea surface height variability from ERS-2 radar altimetry in the Arctic with the output from a high resolution Arctic Ocean circulation model},

hydrological cycle projected by 15 models
participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project phase 3 and used for the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report
are analyzed by computing differences between 2046
and 2065 and 1961 and 2000. The contributions to
changes in precipitation minus evaporation, P-E,
caused thermodynamically by changes in specific
humidity, dynamically by changes in circulation, and
by changes in moisture transports by transient
eddies are evaluated. The thermodynamic and dynamic
contributions are further separated into advective
and divergent components. The nonthermodynamic
contributions are then related to changes in the
mean and transient circulation. The projected change
in P-E involves an intensification of the existing
pattern of P-E with wet areas [the intertropical
convergence zone (ITCZ) and mid-to high latitudes]
getting wetter and arid and semiarid regions of the
subtropics getting drier. In addition, the
subtropical dry zones expand poleward. The
accentuation of the twentieth-century pattern of P-E
is in part explained by increases in specific
humidity via both advection and divergence
terms. Weakening of the tropical divergent
circulation partially opposes the thermodynamic
contribution by creating a tendency to decreased P-E
in the ITCZ and to increased P-E in the descending
branches of the Walker and Hadley cells. The
changing mean circulation also causes decreased P 2
E on the poleward flanks of the subtropics because
the descending branch of the Hadley Cell expands and
the midlatitude meridional circulation cell shifts
poleward. Subtropical drying and poleward moistening
are also contributed to by an increase in poleward
moisture transport by transient eddies. The
thermodynamic contribution to changing P-E, arising
from increased specific humidity, is almost entirely
accounted for by atmospheric warming under fixed
relative humidity.},

The authors investigate the nature of the seasonal precipitation changes in AGCM experiments forced by SST perturbations, which represent idealizations of the changes in annual mean, amplitude, and phase as simulated by CMIP5 models. A uniform SST warming is sufficient to force both amplification and a delay of the annual cycle of precipitation. The amplification is due to an increase in the annual mean vertical water vapor gradient, while the delay is affected by changes in the seasonality of the circulation. A budget analysis of this simulation reveals a large degree of similarity with the CMIP5 results. In...},

coincides with Heinrich Event 1 (H1) in the North
Atlantic, as previously shown from diatom and pollen
evidence (Lamb et al., 2007). The lake deepened at
15.3 cal kyr BP and abruptly returned to freshwater
conditions, when the lake overflowed into the Blue
Nile. Low runoff and lake levels and therefore
rainfall are inferred between 13.0 and 12.5 cal kyr
BP and may represent southerly suppression of the
ITCZ and the associated monsoon front at the time of
the Younger Dryas. Two drought episodes occurred at
8.4 and 7.5 cal kyr BP, and are also interpreted as
a southward shift in the monsoon front. The first of
these events appears to have preceded and been more
significant than the 8.2 cal kyr BP. Precipitation
declined after 6.8 cal kyr BP, although we do not
see an abrupt end to the African Humid Period. This
period culminated in a dry episode at similar to 4.2
cal kyr BP, supporting the view that reduced Nile
flow was a contributing factor to the demise of the
Egyptian Old Kingdom. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

@article{newman07_predictability,
abstract = {A multivariate empirical model is used to show that
predictability of the dominant patterns of tropical
and North Pacific oceanic variability, El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific
decadal oscillation (PDO), is mostly limited to
little more than a year, despite the presence of
spectral peaks on decadal time scales. The model
used is a linear inverse model (LIM) derived from
the observed simultaneous and 1-yr lag correlation
statistics of July-June-averaged SST from the Hadley
Centre Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature
(HadISST) dataset for the years 1900-2002. The model
accurately reproduces the power spectra of the data,
including interannual and interdecadal spectral
peaks that are significant relative to univariate
red noise. Eigenanalysis of the linear dynamical
operator yields propagating eigenmodes that
correspond to these peaks but have very short decay
times and, thus, limited predictability.
Longer-term predictability does exist, however, due
to two stationary eigenmodes that are more weakly
damped. These eigenmodes do not strongly correspond
to the canonical ENSO and PDO patterns. Instead, one
is similar to the 1900-2002 trend and might
represent anthropogenic effects, while the second
represents multidecadal fluctuations of a pattern
that potentially represents natural decadal
variability; however, neither attribution can be
made unambiguously with the analysis presented in
this paper. Predictability of these two stationary
eigenmodes is significantly enhanced by
tropical-North Pacific coupling. Neither stationary
eigenmode is well captured in the control run of any
coupled GCM in the CMIP-3 project of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), perhaps because in
all of the GCMs tropical SST decadal variability is
too weak and North Pacific SSTs are too independent
of the Tropics. A key implication of this analysis
is that the PDO may represent not a single physical
mode but rather the sum of several phenomena, each
of which represents a different red noise with its
own autocorrelation time scale and spatial
pattern. The sum of these red noises can give rise
to apparent PDO "regime shifts" and seeming
characteristics of a long memory process. Such
shifts are not predictable beyond the time scale of
the most rapidly decorrelating noise, less than two
years, although the expected duration of regimes may
be determined from the relative amplitudes of
different eigenmodes.},

In operational forecasts since 1999, snow cover has been used for seven winters, and sea level pressure anomalies for three winters. Presented are skill scores for these seven real-time forecasts and also for 33 winter hindcasts (1972/73–2004/05). The model demonstrates positive skill over much of the eastern United States and northern Eurasia—regions that have eluded skillful predictions among the existing major seasonal forecast centers. Comparison with three leading dynamical forecast systems shows that the statistical model produces superior skill for the same regions.

abstract = {The potential loss or large-scale degradation of the
tropical rainforests has become one of the iconic
images of the impacts of twenty-first century
environmental change and may be one of our century's
most profound legacies. In the Amazon region, the
direct threat of deforestation and degradation is
now strongly intertwined with an indirect challenge
we are just beginning to understand: the possibility
of substantial regional drought driven by global
climate change. The Amazon region hosts more than
half of the world's remaining tropical forests, and
some parts have among the greatest concentrations of
biodiversity found anywhere on Earth. Overall, the
region is estimated to host about a quarter of all
global biodiversity. It acts as one of the major
'flywheels' of global climate, transpiring water and
generating clouds, affecting atmospheric circulation
across continents and hemispheres, and storing
substantial reserves of biomass and soil
carbon. Hence, the ongoing degradation of Amazonia
is a threat to local climate stability and a
contributor to the global atmospheric climate change
crisis. Conversely, the stabilization of Amazonian
deforestation and degradation would be an
opportunity for local adaptation to climate change,
as well as a potential global contributor towards
mitigation of climate change. However, addressing
deforestation in the Amazon raises substantial
challenges in policy, governance, sustainability and
economic science. This paper introduces a theme

these challenges.},

@article{cook09_dust,
abstract = {The "Dust Bowl" drought of the 1930s was highly
unusual for North America, deviating from the
typical pattern forced by "La Nina" with the maximum
drying in the central and northern Plains, warm
temperature anomalies across almost the entire
continent, and widespread dust storms. General
circulation models (GCMs), forced by sea surface
temperatures (SSTs) from the 1930s, produce a
drought, but one that is centered in southwestern
North America and without the warming centered in
the middle of the continent. Here, we show that the
inclusion of forcing from human land degradation
during the period, in addition to the anomalous
SSTs, is necessary to reproduce the anomalous
features of the Dust Bowl drought. The degradation
over the Great Plains is represented in the GCM as a
reduction in vegetation cover and the addition of a
soil dust aerosol source, both consequences of crop
failure. As a result of land surface feedbacks, the
simulation of the drought is much improved when the
new dust aerosol and vegetation boundary conditions
are included. Vegetation reductions explain the high
temperature anomaly over the northern U.S., and the
dust aerosols intensify the drought and move it
northward of the purely ocean-forced drought
pattern. When both factors are included in the model
simulations, the precipitation and temperature
anomalies are of similar magnitude and in a similar
location compared with the
observations. Human-induced land degradation is
likely to have not only contributed to the dust
storms of the 1930s but also amplified the drought,
and these together turned a modest SST-forced
drought into one of the worst environmental
disasters the U.S. has experienced.},

One limitation of that recent study was the relatively small number of hybrid zones available for mapping. In this study, we search for evidence of clustering of contact zones between closely related taxa using data not only from hybrid zones but from species range maps of trees, birds, and mammals and from the position of phylogeographic breaks within species. Digital geographic range maps and a geographic information system approach allowed for accurate and rapid mapping of distributional data. Areas of contact between closely related species and phylogeographic breaks within species clustered into areas characterized by common physiographic features or predicted by previously hypothesized glacial refugia. The results underscore the general importance of geographic barriers to dispersal (mountain chains) and climate change (periods of cooling alternating with periods of warming, which lead to the contraction and expansion of species ranges) in species evolution.},

abstract = {We examine how the seasonality of precipitation
signals embedded within the North American Drought
Atlas varies across the continent. Instrumental
records of average summer (JJA) Palmer Drought
Severity Index (PDSI) are characterized by major
regional differences in the relative importance of
precipitation during summer and winter (DJF). The
Atlas, which is based on a network of
drought-sensitive tree-ring records, is able to
reproduce the main geographic patterns of these
biases, but tree-ring reconstructions exaggerate the
influence of seasonal precipitation anomalies in the
southwestern United States and northern Mexico
(towards a stronger winter signal) and western
Canada (towards a stronger summer signal). Drought
reconstructions from the Southwest and Tex-Mex
regions are tuned mainly to winter precipitation and
display strong teleconnections to both El Nino and
La Ni a. In contrast, winter precipitation signals
are either weak or absent in drought reconstructions
from northwestern North America, and tree-ring
estimates of PDSI show a much less robust
association with the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation. Geographical differences in the
relative strength of seasonal precipitation signals
are likely due to (i) local factors that influence
tree growth but are not incorporated into the PDSI
algorithm and (ii) real differences in regional
climatology. These seasonal biases must be taken
into account when comparing drought reconstructions
across North America, when comparing tree-ring PDSI
to drought records developed from other proxies or
when attempting to use the Drought Atlas to link
past droughts to potential forcing mechanisms.},

abstract = {Present estimates of the future oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 and calculations of CO2-emission scenarios1 are based on the assumption that the natural carbon cycle is in steady state. But it iswell known from palaeoclimate records2, 3, 4, 5 and modelling studies6, 7, 8, 9 that the climate system has more than one equilibrium state, and that perturbations can trigger transitions between them. Anticipated future changes in today's climate system due to human activities have the potential to weaken the thermohaline circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean10, 11, 12, which would greatly modify estimates of future oceanic CO2 uptake13. Here we use a simple coupled atmosphere–ocean climate model to show that the Atlantic thermohaline circulation is not only sensitive to the final atmospheric CO2 concentration attained, but also depends on the rate of change of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. A modelled increase to 750 parts per million by volume (p.p.m.v.) CO2 within 100 years (corresponding approximately to a continuation of today's growth rate) leads to a permanent shut-down of the thermohaline circulation. If the final atmospheric concentration of 750 p.p.m.v. CO2 is attained more slowly, the thermohaline circulation simply slows down. The reason for this rate-sensitive response of the climate system lies with the transfer of buoyancy in the form of heat and fresh water from the uppermost layers of the ocean into the deep waters below. This sensitivity of the simulated thermohaline circulation to the rate ofchange of atmospheric CO2 concentration has potentially important implications for the choice of future CO2-emission scenarios1.},

Several independent data sets show that stratospheric aerosols have increased in abundance since 2000. Near-global satellite aerosol data imply a negative radiative forcing due to stratospheric aerosol changes over this period of about --0.1 watt per square meter, reducing the recent global warming that would otherwise have occurred. Observations from earlier periods are limited but suggest an additional negative radiative forcing of about --0.1 watt per square meter from 1960 to 1990.

The data are taken from `horizontal' tracks of research aircraft and from `vertical' trajectories of research dropsondes. It is argued that any attempt to represent the energy distribution in the atmosphere quantitatively must have a proper basis in molecular physics, a prerequisite to accommodate the observed long-tailed velocity probability distributions and the implied effects on radiative transfer, atmospheric chemistry, turbulent structure and the definition of temperature itself. The relationship between fluctuations and dissipation is discussed in a framework of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and a link between maximization of entropy production and scale invariance is hypothesized.

abstract = {Singular systems (or singular spectrum) analysis
(SSA) was originally proposed for noise reduction in
the analysis of experimental data and is now
becoming widely used to identify intermittent or
modulated oscillations in geophysical and climatic
time series. Progress has been hindered by a lack of
effective statistical tests to discriminate between
potential oscillations and anything but the simplest
form of noise, that is, ''white'' (independent,
identically distributed) noise, in which power is
independent of frequency. The authors show how the
basic formalism of SSA provides a natural test for
modulated oscillations against an arbitrary
''colored noise'' null hypothesis. This test, Monte
Carlo SSA, is illustrated using synthetic data in
three situations: (i) where there is prior knowledge
of the power-spectral characteristics of the noise,
a situation expected in some laboratory and
engineering applications, or when the ''noise''
against which the data is being tested consists of
the output of an independently specified model, such
as a climate model; (ii) where a simple hypothetical
noise model is tested, namely, that the data
consists only of white or colored noise; and (iii)
where a composite. hypothetical noise model is
tested, assuming some deterministic components have
already been found in the data, such as a trend or
annual cycle, and it needs to be established whether
the remainder may be attributed to noise. The
authors examine two historical temperature records
and show that the strength of the evidence provided
by SSA for interannual and interdecadal climate
oscillations in such data has been considerably
overestimated. In contrast, multiple inter- and
subannual oscillatory components are identified in
an extended Southern Oscillation index at a high
significance level. The authors explore a number of
variations on the Monte Carlo SSA algorithm and note
that it is readily applicable to multivariate
series, covering standard empirical orthogonal
functions and multichannel SSA.},

abstract = {The delta O-18 isotopic composition of stalagmite
calcite frequently contains a climate signal, but
one that is difficult to interpret in terms of
either rainfall or temperature. Over
glacial-interglacial time periods and decadal
sampling resolution, stalagmite delta O-18 clearly
contains a 'first order' climate signal where the
magnitude of changes in temperature and
ocean/atmospheric circulation dominate the delta
O-18 signature. However, at annual-biennial
resolution sampling, and within interglacial
periods, the magnitude of climate changes is
smaller, and variability in delta O-18 introduced by
soil, karst groundwater and cave processes can
introduce considerable uncertainty into the climatic
interpretation of stalagmite delta O-18
records. Here, two approaches that can quantify the
climate signal contained with stalagmite delta O-18
are discussed. Firstly, linear regression based
approaches are reviewed, which correlate stalagmite
delta O-18 with instrumental climate parameters such
as temperature and rainfall. The advantages and
disadvantages of complex linear regression
approaches that attempt to account for groundwater
mixing within the karst aquifer are
discussed. Secondly, a forward modelling approach is
introduced, where stalagmite delta O-18 is modelled
from rainfall delta O-18, surface climate parameters
and a simple karst hydrology model. Using a case
study from Gibraltar, this latter approach
demonstrates that between stalagmite variability in
delta O-18 of the order of 1 parts per thousand can
be explained solely by differences in karst
hydrology. Forward modelling suggests that a similar
variability in delta O-18 might be observed between
stalagmites within a cave, or between caves within a
homogenous climate region, and highlights the
difficulty in attempting to use delta O-18 as a
paleo-thermometer. (C) 2009 Elsevier BM. All rights

abstract = {West Africa includes a semi-arid zone between the
Sahara Desert and the humid Gulf of Guinea coast,
approximately between 10 degrees N and 20 degrees N,
which is irrigated by summer monsoon rains. This
article refers to the region as the Sahel. Rain-fed
agriculture is the primary sustenance for Sahel
populations, and severe droughts (in the 1970s and
1980s), therefore, have devastating negative
societal impacts. The future frequency of Sahel
droughts and the evolution of its hydrological
balance are therefore of great interest. The article
reviews 10 recent research studies that attempt to
discover how climate changes will affect the
hydrology of the Sahel throughout the 21st
century. All 10 studies rely on atmosphere-ocean
global climate model (AOGCM) simulations based on a
range of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Many of
the simulations are contained in the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change archives
for Assessment Reports {\#}3 and {\#}4. Two of the studies
use AOGCM data to drive regional climate
models. Seven studies make projections for the first
half of the 21st century and eight studies make
projections for the second half. Some studies make
projections of wetter conditions and some predict
more frequent droughts, and each describes the
atmospheric processes associated with its
prediction. Only one study projects more frequent
droughts before 2050, and that is only for
continent-wide degradation in vegetation cover. The
challenge to correctly simulate Sahel rainfall
decadal trends is particularly daunting because
multiple physical mechanisms compete to drive the
trend upwards or downwards. A variety of model
deficiencies, regarding the simulation of one or
more of these physical processes, taints models'
climate change projections. Consequently, no
consensus emerges regarding the impact of
anticipated greenhouse gas forcing on the hydrology
of the Sahel in the second half of the 21st

abstract = {The causes and global context of the North American
drought between 1998 and 2004 are examined using
atmospheric reanalyses and ensembles of atmosphere
model simulations variously forced by global SSTs or
tropical Pacific SSTs alone. The drought divides
into two distinct time intervals. Between 1998 and
2002 it coincided with a persistent La Ni (n) over
tildea-like state in the tropical Pacific, a cool
tropical troposphere, poleward shifted jet streams,
and, in the zonal mean, eddy-driven descent in
midlatitudes. During the winters reduced
precipitation over North America in the climate
models was sustained by anomalous subsidence and
reductions of moisture convergence by the stationary
flow and transient eddies. During the summers
reductions of evaporation and mean flow moisture
convergence drove the precipitation reduction, while
transient eddies acted diffusively to oppose
this. During these years the North American drought
fitted into a global pattern of circulation and
hydroclimate anomalies with noticeable zonal and
hemispheric symmetry. During the later period of
the drought, from 2002 to 2004, weak El Ni (n) over
tildeo conditions prevailed and, while the global
climate adjusted accordingly, western North America
remained, uniquely among midlatitude regions, in
drought. The ensemble mean of the climate model
simulations did not simulate the continuation of the
drought in these years, suggesting that the
termination of the drought was largely unpredictable
in terms of global ocean conditions. The global
context of the most recent, turn of the century,
drought is compared to the five prior persistent
North American droughts in the instrumental record
from the mid-nineteenth century on. A classic La Ni
(n) over tildea pattern of ocean temperature in the
Pacific is common to all. A cold Indian Ocean, also
typical of La Ni (n) over tildea, is common to all
five prior droughts, but not the most recent
one. Except in southern South America the global
pattern of precipitation anomalies of the turn of
the century drought is similar to that during the
five prior droughts. These comparisons suggest that
the earlier period of this most recent drought is
the latest in a series of multiyear droughts forced
by persistent changes in tropical Pacific Ocean
temperatures. Warm tropical North Atlantic Ocean
temperatures may play a secondary role.},

and adjacent Southwest are regions particularly
sensitive to SST variability, and strong La Nina
events that occurred during 1946-1956 exposed that
region's drought vulnerability. Drought severity
over the Northern Plains during 1932-1939 was likely

variability. The Northern Plains lies within a

variability, and that region's drought exhibited
little sensitivity to SST conditions during the Dust

that current generation climate models generally

different climate forcings to explain the Hurst
exponent distribution and to account for
discrepancies in scaling behavior between different
observational products. We conclude that

elucidating the physical mechanisms underlying this

abstract = {We reconstructed the late-Holocene surface-moisture
history and vegetation dynamics of a raised bog in
Michigan using testate amoebae, peat humification,
pollen, stomata and plant macrofossils. Our primary
objective was to compare bog palaeohydrology with
the water-level history of Lake Michigan, and to
regional and local vegetation changes. Hydrologic
histories inferred from testate amoebae and
humification show similar trends, and correspond
with records of past water-level variability in Lake
Michigan. The bog clearly shows effective-moisture
increases during the Algoma highstand (similar
to3200-2300 cal. BP) and a later unnamed highstand
(similar to1900-1300 cal. BP). Some higher-frequency
fluctuations are also similar. The good
correspondence indicates that bog hydrology and the
water levels of Lake Michigan have been driven by
changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation
patterns for at least the past 3500 years. Climate
during the Algoma highstand may have been
spatiotemporally complex, with increasing moisture
occurring several hundred years earlier in the
northern portion of the western Great Lakes
basin. Locally, the expansion and contraction of
Picea populations on the bog surface was probably
directly related to moisture conditions. The
well-documented decline in Fagus populations in the
central Great Lakes region after 1000 cal. BP is
contemporaneous with a major shift towards drier
conditions, suggesting that relative dryness caused
the decline.},

abstract = {Droughts are one of the most devastating natural
hazards faced by the United States today. Severe
droughts of the twentieth century have had large
impacts on economies, society, and the environment,
especially in the Great Plains. However, the
instrumental record of the last 100 years contains
only a limited subset of drought realizations. One
must turn to the paleoclimatic record to examine the
full range of past drought variability, including
the range of magnitude and duration, and thus gain
the improved understanding needed for society to
anticipate and plan for droughts of the
future. Historical documents, tree rings,
archaeological remains, lake sediment, and
geomorphic data make it clear that the droughts of
the twentieth century, including those of the 1930s
and 1950s, were eclipsed several times by droughts
earlier in the last 2000 years, and as recently as
the late sixteenth century. In general, some
droughts prior to 1600 appear to be characterized by
longer duration (i.e., multidecadal) and greater
spatial extent than those of the twentieth
century. The authors' assessment of the full range
of past natural drought variability, deduced from a
comprehensive review of the paleoclimatic
literature, suggests that droughts more severe than
those of the 1930s and 1950s are likely to occur in
the future, a likelihood that might be exacerbated
by greenhouse warming in the next
century. Persistence conditions that lead to
decadal-scale drought may be related to
low-frequency variations, or base-state shifts, in
both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, although more
research is needed to understand the mechanisms of
severe drought.},

abstract = {The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), defined as
the leading empirical orthogonal function of North
Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies, is a
widely used index for decadal variability. It is
shown that the PDO can be recovered from a
reconstruction of North Pacific sea surface

autoregressive model and forcing by variability of
the Aleutian low, El Nino-Southern Oscillation

Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension. The latter results from
oceanic Rossby waves that are forced by North
Pacific Ekman pumping. The SST response patterns to
these processes are not orthogonal, and they
determine the spatial characteristics of the
PDO. The importance of the different forcing,
processes is frequency dependent. At interannual
time scales, forcing from ENSO and the Aleutian low
determines the response in equal parts. At decadal
time scales, zonal advection in the Kuroshio-Oyashio
Extension, ENSO, and anomalies of the Aleutian low
each account for similar amounts of the PDO
variance. These, results support the hypothesis that
the PDO is not a dynamical mode, but arises from the

abstract = {The relative influences of Indian and Pacific Ocean
modes of variability on Australian rainfall and soil
moisture are investigated for seasonal, interannual,
and decadal time scales. For the period 1900-2006,
observations, reanalysis products, and hindcasts of
soil moisture during the cool season (June October)
are used to assess the impacts of El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD)
on southeastern Australia and the Murray Darling
Basin, two regions that have recently suffered
severe droughts. A distinct asymmetry is found in
the impacts of the opposite phases of both ENSO and
IOD on Australian rainfall and soil moisture. There
are significant differences between the dominant
drivers of drought at interannual and decadal time
scales. On interannual time scales, both ENSO and
the IOD modify southeastern Australian soil
moisture, with the driest (wettest) conditions over
the southeast and more broadly over large parts of
Australia occurring during years when an El Nino and
a positive IOD event (La Nina and a negative IOD
event) co-occur. The atmospheric circulation
associated with these responses is
discussed. Lower-frequency variability over
southeastern Australia, however, including multiyear
drought periods, seems to be more robustly related
to Indian Ocean temperatures than Pacific
conditions. The frequencies of both positive and
negative IOD events are significantly different
during periods of prolonged drought compared to
extended periods of "normal" rainfall. In contrast,
the frequency of ENSO events remains largely
unchanged during prolonged dry and wet periods. For
the Murray Darling Basin, there appears to be a
significant influence by La Nina and both positive
and negative IOD events. In particular, La Nina
plays a much more prominent role than for more
southern regions, especially on interannual time
scales and during prolonged wet periods. For
prolonged dry (wet) periods, positive IOD events
also occur in unusually high (low) numbers.},

The cloud scheme uses a probability distribution function (PDF) of the total water whose variance and skewness coefficient are diagnosed from the amount of condensed water produced at the subgrid scale by cumulus convection and at the large scale by supersaturation, from the degree of saturation of the environment, and from the lower bound of the total water distribution that is taken equal to zero.

abstract = {Analytical theory is used to examine the linear
response of a meridionally unbounded stratified
ocean to large-scale, low-frequency wind
forcing. The following results, applied mainly to
the equatorial Pacific, were obtained. (i) Provided
that the wind stress curl vanishes at large distance
from the equator, a general Sverdrup solution is
valid in the quasi-steady (frequency omega -{\textgreater} 0)
limit. The meridionally averaged zonal flow toward
the western boundary layer is zero so that there is
no net mass flow into the boundary layer and the
large-scale boundary condition is therefore
satisfied. This solution predicts a zero pycnocline
response in the eastern equatorial Pacific. It
therefore predicts that, for the eastern equatorial
Pacific, a slow weakening of the equatorial trade
winds will not lead to long-term El Nino conditions
there. (ii) Consistent with observations and other
previous work, for finite but small frequencies
there are two modes of equatorial motion. One is a
"tilt'' mode in which the equatorial sea level and
thermocline are tilted by the in-phase zonal wind
stress and the other is an equatorial warm water
volume (WWV) mode in which the discharge of
equatorial warm water (negative WWV anomaly) lags
the wind stress forcing by a quarter of a
period. (iii) The amplitude of the WWV mode
approaches zero like omega(1/2). Therefore, as omega
-{\textgreater} 0, the equatorial solution reduces to the tilt
mode. (iv) The WWV mode is not due to a dominant
meridional divergence driven by the wind, as
suggested by some previous work. Meridional and
zonal divergence approximately cancel. Reflection of
energy at both ocean boundaries together with the
strong dependence of long Rossby wave speed on
latitude is crucial to the existence of the
disequilibrium WWV mode. Because higher-latitude
Rossby waves travel so much more slowly, the Rossby
waves reflecting from the western ocean boundary are
not in phase. This gives rise to a reflected
equatorial Kelvin wave and a WWV that is not in
phase with the wind stress forcing. (v) Observations
from past work have shown that much low-frequency
wave energy, particularly westward propagating
Rossby wave energy poleward of about 5 degrees N and
5 degrees S, is damped out before it reaches the
western ocean boundary. In this way dissipation
likely has a strong influence on the equatorial
Kelvin wave reflection and hence the disequilibrium
WWV.},

delta(18)O is about 0.4 degrees C, assuming no
seawater delta(18)O influence; for Sr/Ca, the
observational error is about 0.5 degrees C. Singular
spectrum analysis of the delta(18)O time series
suggests that 1/3 of the variance is explained by
SST anomaly and that this variance may be separated
from other signals in the frequency domain. The
interannual component of the delta(18)O record
shares 70{\%} variance with the interannual component
of local SST anomaly estimates (rho=-0.84) and
correlates as highly with NINO3 region (150 degrees
W-90 degrees W, 5 degrees N-5 degrees S) SST anomaly
estimates; comparison of annual averages of the
delta(18)O data with analyzed SST for 55 years
suggests that the error in deriving annually
averaged SST anomalies at Kiritimati is about 0.4
degrees C. A global SST correlation analysis
suggests significant correlation with the rest of
the Pacific Basin and the tropical Indian and
Atlantic sectors. The ocean-wide level of
correlation achieved using the coral data is
indistinguishable from that achieved using the NINO3
SST anomaly index and suggests that a few
well-located coral reconstructions with low
observational error may be sufficient to reconstruct
the global SST anomaly field associated with ENSO
activity.},

abstract = {AbstractThis paper examines the trajectories followed by intense intrusions of moist air into the Arctic polar region during autumn and winter and their impact on local temperature and sea ice concentration. It is found that the vertical structure of the warming associated with moist intrusions is bottom amplified, corresponding to a transition of local conditions from a “cold clear” state with a strong inversion to a “warm opaque” state with a weaker inversion. In the marginal sea ice zone of the Barents Sea, the passage of an intrusion also causes a retreat of the ice margin, which persists for many days after the intrusion has passed. The authors find that there is a positive trend in the number of intrusion events crossing 70°N during December and January that can explain roughly 45{\%} of the surface air temperature and 30{\%} of the sea ice concentration trends observed in the Barents Sea during the past two decades.},

@article{Pithan2014,
abstract = {Climate change is amplified in the Arctic region. Arctic amplification has been found in past warm 1 and glacial 2 periods, as well as in historical observations 3,4 and climate model experiments 5,6 . Feedback eeects associated with tem-perature, water vapour and clouds have been suggested to contribute to amplified warming in the Arctic, but the surface albedo feedback—the increase in surface absorption of solar radiation when snow and ice retreat—is often cited as the main contributor 7–10 . However, Arctic amplification is also found in models without changes in snow and ice cover 11,12 . Here we analyse climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 archive to quantify the contributions of the various feedbacks. We find that in the simulations, the largest contribution to Arctic amplification comes from a temperature feedbacks: as the surface warms, more energy is radiated back to space in low latitudes, compared with the Arctic. This eeect can be attributed to both the diierent vertical structure of the warming in high and low latitudes, and a smaller increase in emitted blackbody radiation per unit warming at colder temperatures. We find that the surface albedo feedback is the second main contributor to Arctic amplification and that other contributions are substantially smaller or even oppose Arctic amplification. A quantitative understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying Arctic amplification is key to developing confidence in and constraining model projections of Arctic climate change, and to focusing research efforts and model–data comparisons on the most important processes. It is well established that Arctic amplification is in part caused by the surface albedo feedback 5,11,13 . Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fourth assessment report stated that it was not clear whether the surface albedo feedback was the main cause of Arctic amplification 14 , many recent studies indicate or assume that surface albedo feedback is the main cause 7–10 . However, Arctic amplification does occur in models without surface albedo feedback 11,12 and Arctic amplification in coupled climate models (Fig. 1) has been shown to be primarily caused by feedbacks acting on terrestrial longwave radiation 15 . The latter implies that the surface albedo feedback, which changes the absorption of solar shortwave radiation, can play only a secondary role in causing Arctic amplification. Important contributions to Arctic amplification have been suggested to result from the water vapour feedback caused by the greenhouse effect of additional water vapour 12 , the cloud feedback due to changes in the effect of clouds on the Earth's radiative balance 16 and the lapse-rate feedback associated with the vertical structure of warming 5,17 . Changes in atmospheric 18 and oceanic heat transport 6,19,20 are also thought to contribute to Arctic amplification. The direct impact of rising temperatures on outgoing longwave radiation at the top of atmosphere (TOA; temperature feedback) can be decomposed into a contribution from vertically uniform warming of the surface and troposphere (Planck feedback) and a contribution from tropospheric warming that deviates from the vertically uniform profile (lapse-rate feedback). The lapse-rate feedback connected to the vertical structure of atmospheric warming is known to contribute to stronger Arctic than tropical warming 5,17 . In the tropics, air parcels rising in deep convective clouds create a tight coupling between surface and upper-tropospheric temperatures. In a warming climate, these air parcels release more latent heat, steepening the moist adiabatic lapse rate and thus causing greater warming in the upper troposphere than at the surface. Under this top-heavy warming profile, a smaller increase in surface temperatures is required to offset a given TOA imbalance. In the Arctic, cold dense air close to the surface is hardly mixed with the lighter air aloft, leaving radiation as the primary coupling mechanism. Radiative coupling does not impose a certain lapse rate and surface-based warming remains confined to the lowermost parts of the atmosphere. Under this bottom-heavy warming profile, a larger increase in surface temperatures is required to offset a given TOA imbalance. The lapse-rate feedback is therefore negative in the tropics and positive in the Arctic. The Planck feedback is generally overlooked as a contributor to Arctic amplification, even though the underlying physics is well established 21 . The longwave radiation (R) emitted by the Earth's surface rises with temperature (T) following R = $\sigma$ T 4 , where is the surface emissivity close to unity and $\sigma$ the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. Thus, a given increase in emitted radiation requires a larger temperature increase at colder background temperatures. For example, at 30 • C, an external forcing of 1 W m −2 can be balanced by a 0.16 • C warming, whereas at −30 • C a 0.31 • C warming is required to balance the same forcing. As the Arctic is colder than the tropics, the Planck feedback in itself causes Arctic amplification. The local temperature change required to offset the radiative imbalance caused by a given forcing or feedback corresponds to that mechanism's warming contribution. We assess indi-vidual contributions to Arctic amplification as the difference between contributions to Arctic and tropical warming (Fig. 2). Beyond the simple example quoted above, and accounting for the effects of atmosphere and clouds, the radiative flux change at the surface and TOA associated to a known surface temperature change can be computed from radiative kernels 22 . We here invert the kernel method to compute the local warming contributions of the feedbacks. The contribution of the Planck feedback's spatial structure to the spatial structure of warming is estimated as the difference between the warm-ing response for a globally averaged and for the local Planck feedback (Methods).},

abstract = {To extend the linear stochastically forced paradigm
of tropical sea surface temperature (SST)
variability to the subsurface ocean, a linear
inverse model (LIM) is constructed from the
simultaneous and 3-month lag covariances of observed
3-month running mean anomalies of SST, thermocline
depth, and zonal wind stress. This LIM is then used
to identify the empirically-determined linear
dynamics with physical processes to gauge their
relative importance to ENSO evolution. Optimal
growth of SST anomalies over several months is
triggered by both an initial SST anomaly and a
central equatorial Pacific thermocline anomaly that
propagates slowly eastward while leading the
amplifying SST anomaly. The initial SST and
thermocline anomalies each produce roughly half the
SST amplification. If interactions between the sea
surface and the thermocline are removed in the
linear dynamical operator, the SST anomaly undergoes
less optimal growth but is also more persistent, and
its location shifts from the eastern to central
Pacific. Optimal growth is also found to be
essentially the result of two stable eigenmodes with
similar structure but differing 2- and 4-year
periods evolving from initial destructive to
constructive interference. Variations among ENSO
events could then be a consequence not of changing
stability characteristics but of random excitation
of these two eigenmodes, which represent different
balances between surface and subsurface coupled
dynamics. As found in previous studies, the impact
of the additional variables on LIM SST forecasts is
relatively small for short time scales. Over time
intervals greater than about 9 months, however, the
additional variables both significantly enhance
forecast skill and predict lag covariances and
associated power spectra whose closer agreement with
observations enhances the validation of the linear
model. Moreover, a secondary type of optimal growth
exists that is not present in a LIM constructed from
SST alone, in which initial SST anomalies in the
southwest tropical Pacific and Indian ocean play a
larger role than on shorter time scales, apparently
driving sustained off-equatorial wind stress
anomalies in the eastern Pacific that result in a
more persistent equatorial thermocline anomaly and a
more protracted (and predictable) ENSO event.},

Numerical solutions to the linearized equation for wave propagation are obtained by assuming a realistic profile of zonal winds as the basic state and imposing observed monthly mean heights of the 500-mb surface as the lower boundary condition. The computed wave structures in the meridional section show good agreement with the observed state for the component of zonal wavenumber 1. For wavenumber 2, the computed amplitude is too small to compare with the observed. Wave energy density attains a maximum in the lower and middle stratosphere at high altitudes, where strong upward transfer of wave energy appears.

especially for small areas and short durations; (c)
the most severe agricultural droughts were also
among the most severe hydrologic droughts, however,
the early 2000s western U. S. drought occupies a
larger portion of the hydrologic drought envelope
curve than does its agricultural companion; and (d)
runoff tends to recover in response to precipitation
more quickly than soil moisture, so the severity of
hydrologic drought during the 1930s and 1950s was
dampened by short wet spells, while the severity of
the early 2000s drought remained high because of the
relative absence of these short-term phenomena.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to quantify climatic
controls on the area burned by. re in different
vegetation types in the western United States. We
demonstrate that wild. re area burned (WFAB) in the
American West was controlled by climate during the
20th century (1916-2003). Persistent
ecosystem-specific correlations between climate and
WFAB are grouped by vegetation type
(ecoprovinces). Most mountainous ecoprovinces
exhibit strong year-of-fire relationships with low
precipitation, low Palmer drought severity index
(PDSI), and high temperature. Grass-and
shrub-dominated ecoprovinces had positive
relationships with antecedent precipitation or
PDSI. For 1977-2003, a few climate variables explain
33-87{\%} (mean = 64{\%}) of WFAB, indicating strong
linkages between climate and area burned. For
1916-2003, the relationships are weaker, but climate
explained 25-57{\%} (mean = 39{\%}) of the
variability. The variance in WFAB is proportional to
the mean squared for different data sets at
different spatial scales. The importance of
antecedent climate (summer drought in forested
ecosystems and antecedent winter precipitation in
shrub and grassland ecosystems) indicates that the
mechanism behind the observed. re-climate
relationships is climatic preconditioning of large
areas of low fuel moisture via drying of existing
fuels or fuel production and drying. The impacts of
climate change on. re regimes will therefore vary
with the relative energy or water limitations of
ecosystems. Ecoprovinces proved a useful compromise
between ecologically imprecise state-level and
localized gridded fire data. The differences in
climate . re relationships among the ecoprovinces
underscore the need to consider ecological context
(vegetation, fuels, and seasonal climate) to
identify specific climate drivers of WFAB. Despite
the possible influence of. re suppression,
exclusion, and fuel treatment, WFAB is still
substantially controlled by climate. The
implications for planning and management are that
future WFAB and adaptation to climate change will
likely depend on ecosystem-specific, seasonal
variation in climate. In fuel-limited ecosystems,
fuel treatments can probably mitigate. re
vulnerability and increase resilience more readily
than in climate-limited ecosystems, in which large
severe. res under extreme weather conditions will
continue to account for most area burned.},

to understand patterns of natural climate
variability, on decade to century timescales, and
the role of anthropogenic forcing(1 - 8). These
reconstructions have mainly used tree- ring data and
other data sets of annual to decadal

multicentennial timescales that may not be captured
by tree- ring data(9,10). Here we reconstruct
Northern Hemisphere temperatures for the past 2,000
years by combining low- resolution proxies with
tree- ring data, using a wavelet transform
technique(11) to achieve timescale- dependent
processing of the data. Our reconstruction shows
larger multicentennial variability than most
previous multi- proxy reconstructions(1 - 4,7), but
agrees well with temperatures reconstructed from
borehole measurements(12) and with temperatures
obtained with a general circulation
model(13,14). According to our reconstruction, high
temperatures - similar to those observed in the
twentieth century before 1990 occurred around AD
1000 to 1100, and minimum temperatures that are
about 0.7K below the average of 1961 - 90 occurred
around AD 1600. This large natural variability in
the past suggests an important role of natural
multicentennial variability that is likely to
continue.},

Additionally, the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble Project (LENS) is used to quantify the forced response and internal variability in the model. A dipole spatial pattern of sea-ice thickness variability is shown in both PIOMAS and LENS with opposite signs of polarity between the East Siberian Sea and near the Fram Strait. As future sea ice thins, this dipole structure of variability is reduced, and the largest interannual variability is found only along the northern Greenland coastline. Under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) projection, average September sea-ice thickness falls below 0.5 m by the end of the 21st century. However, a regional perspective shows internal variability contributes to an uncertainty of 10 to 20 years for the timing of the first September sea-ice thickness less than 0.5 m in the marginal seas.},

different imprints of regional climate factors. At
the same time, all coral records show clear

stationary correlation with ENSO, Chagos corals show
evidence for non-stationary delta(18)O/ENSO

corals show a strong relationship with ENSO when the
forcing is strong (1880-1920, 1970 to present). Our
results indicate that the coral delta(18)O, in

improved understanding of droughts and their

the knowledge about the controls on drought, and the
ways in which changes in climate may impact
droughts. In this study, 1) major drought patterns
across the United States have been defined, 2) the
robustness of these patterns over time using
tree-ring-based drought reconstructions have been
evaluated, and 3) the drought patterns with respect

suggested that there are two major drought patterns
across North America, which together account for
about 30{\%} of the total variance in drought
patterns-one resembles the classic ENSO
teleconnection, and the other displays an east-west
drought dipole. The same two patterns are evident in
the instrumental data and the reconstructed drought
data for two different periods, 1404-2003 and

one of the most prominent summertime climate

seasonal variability in a region lying between the
Amazon and the La Plata Basin. Much of the recent
progress is derived from complementary international
programs, such as the Monsoon Experiment South

international programs such as the Large Scale
Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in the Amazon Basin
(LBA) and the La Plata Basin (LPB) Regional
Hydroclimate Project, which includes the CLARIS LPB

Assessment and Impact Studies in La Plata Basin
Project. The latter assesses atmosphere-land surface
interactions, the role of land use changes and
aerosols from biomass burning considered as sources
of variability and change in the SAMS functioning,
characteristics and behaviour. The SAMS region is
particularly susceptible to variations of climate
due to the importance of hydroelectricity generation
and the agricultural base of local economies. Also
addressed in this report are projections of climate
change and extremes, which are important for impact

important processes that control the monsoonal

The impacts of these changes, which include dramatic ice loss from ice sheets and rapid declines in Arctic sea ice, could be quite large in terms of sea level rise and global climate. NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), currently planned for launch in 2015, is specifically intended to quantify the amount of change in ice sheets and sea ice and provide key insights into their behavior. It will achieve these objectives through the use of precise laser measurements of surface elevation, building on the groundbreaking capabilities of its predecessor, the Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat). In particular, ICESat-2 will measure the temporal and spatial character of ice sheet elevation change to enable assessment of ice sheet mass balance and examination of the underlying mechanisms that control it. The precision of ICESat-2's elevation measurement will also allow for accurate measurements of sea ice freeboard height, from which sea ice thickness and its temporal changes can be estimated. ICESat-2 will provide important information on other components of the Earth System as well, most notably large-scale vegetation biomass estimates through the measurement of vegetation canopy height. When combined with the original ICESat observations, ICESat-2 will provide ice change measurements across more than a 15-year time span. Its significantly improved laser system will also provide observations with much greater spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and accuracy than has ever been possible before.},

variability in the CGCM, a wind-forced shallow water
model, and a simple mixed layer model together with
existing and new theoretical results are used to
improve upon this stochastic paradigm and to provide
a new theory for the origin of decadal ENSO-like
patterns like the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation
and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In this theory,
ENSO-driven wind-stress variability forces internal
equatorially-trapped Kelvin waves that propagate
towards the eastern boundary. Kelvin waves can
excite reflected internal westward propagating
equatorially-trapped Rossby waves (RWs) and
coastally-trapped waves (CTWs). CTWs have no impact
on the off-equatorial sub-surface ocean outside the
coastal wave guide, whereas the RWs do. If the
frequency of the incident wave is too high, then
only CTWs are excited. At lower frequencies, both
CTWs and RWs can be excited. The lower the
frequency, the greater the fraction of energy
transmitted to RWs. This lowers the characteristic
frequency (reddens the spectrum) of variability off
the equator relative to its equatorial
counterpart. At low frequencies, dissipation acts as
an additional low pass filter that becomes more
effective, as latitude increases. At the same time,
ENSO-driven off-equatorial surface heating anomalies
drive mixed layer temperature responses in both
hemispheres. Both the eastern boundary interactions
and the accumulation of surface heat fluxes by the
surface mixed layer act to low pass filter the
ENSO-forcing. The resulting off-equatorial
variability is therefore more coherent with low pass
filtered (decadal) ENSO indices [e.g. NINO3
sea-surface temperature (SST)] than with unfiltered
ENSO indices. Consequently large correlations
between variability and NINO3 extend further
poleward on decadal time-scales than they do on
interannual time-scales. This explains why decadal
ENSO-like patterns have a broader meridional
structure than their interannual counterparts. This
difference in appearance can occur even if ENSO
indices do not have any predictability beyond
interannual time-scales. The wings around 15-20
degrees S, and sub-surface variability at many other
locations are predictable on interannual and
multi-year time-scales. This includes westward
propagating internal RWs within about 25 degrees of
the equator. The slowest of these take up to 4 years
to reach the western boundary. This sub-surface
predictability has significant oceanographic
interest. However, it is linked to only low levels
of SST variability. Consequently, extrapolation of
delayed action oscillator theory to decadal
time-scales might not be justified.},

abstract = {A detailed vertically integrated atmospheric heat
and energy budget is presented along with estimated
heat budgets at the surface and top-of-atmosphere
for the subtropics. It is shown that the total
energy transports are remarkably seamless in spite
of greatly varying mechanisms. From the Tropics to
about 318 latitude, the primary transport mechanisms
are the Hadley and Walker overturning
circulations. In the extratropics the energy
transports are carried out by baroclinic eddies
broadly organized into storm tracks and
quasi-stationary waves that covary in a symbiotic
way as the location and activity in storm tracks are
determined by, and in turn help maintain through
eddy transports, the quasi-stationary flow. In the
upward branch of the Hadley cell, the predominant
diabatic process is latent heating that results from
convergence of moisture by the circulation
itself. Hence large poleward transports of dry
static energy are compensated by equatorward
transports of latent energy, resulting in a modest
poleward transport of moist static energy. The
subsidence warming in the downward branch is
compensated by cooling in the subtropics that mainly
arises from energy transport to higher latitudes by
transient baroclinic eddies that are stronger in the
winter hemisphere. Effectively, the outgoing
longwave radiation to space is distributed over
middle and high latitudes and is not limited to the
clear dry regions in the subtropics. Further, some
of the radiative cooling in the subtropics is a
consequence of the circulation. Hence the cooling by
transient eddies in the subtropics is a fundamental
driver of the observed Hadley circulation and
realizes the seamless transport from Tropics to
extratropics, while tropical sea surface
temperatures over the oceans determine where the
upward branch is located. The relatively clear skies
in the subtropics further provide for ample
absorption of solar radiation at the surface where
it feeds strong evaporation, which exceeds
precipitation, and supplies the equatorward flow of
latent energy into the upward branch of the Hadley
circulation as well as the poleward transports into
midlatitude storm tracks. The evaporation is
sufficiently strong that it is also compensated by a
subsurface ocean heat transport that in turn is
driven by the Hadley circulation surface winds.},

defined by interpolation of gauge observations over

historical observations over ocean (PREC/O). This
paper documents the creation of the land component
of the analyses (PREC/L) on a 2.5degrees

analyses are derived from gauge observations from
over 17 000 stations collected in the Global
Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), version 2,
and the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System (CAMS)
datasets. To determine the most suitable objective
analysis procedure for gridding, the analyses
generated by four published objective analysis
techniques [those of Cressman, Barnes, and Shepard,
and the optimal interpolation (OI) method of Gandin]
were compared. The evaluation demonstrated two
crucial points: 1) better results are obtained when
interpolating anomalies rather than the
precipitation totals, and 2) the OI analysis
procedure provided the most accurate and stable
analyses among the four algorithms that were
tested. Based on these results, the OI technique was
used to create monthly gridded analyses of
precipitation over the global land areas for the
53-yr period from 1948 to 2000. In addition, some
diagnostic investigations of the seasonal and
interannual variability of large-scale precipitation
over the global land areas are presented. The mean

observed in the PREC/L showed good agreement with
those in several published gauge-based datasets, and
the anomaly patterns associated with ENSO resemble

Here we demonstrate that the decrease in autumn Arctic sea ice area is linked to changes in the winter Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation that have some resemblance to the negative phase of the winter Arctic oscillation. However, the atmospheric circulation change linked to the reduction of sea ice shows much broader meridional meanders in midlatitudes and clearly different interannual variability than the classical Arctic oscillation. This circulation change results in more frequent episodes of blocking patterns that lead to increased cold surges over large parts of northern continents. Moreover, the increase in atmospheric water vapor content in the Arctic region during late autumn and winter driven locally by the reduction of sea ice provides enhanced moisture sources, supporting increased heavy snowfall in Europe during early winter and the northeastern and midwestern United States during winter. We conclude that the recent decline of Arctic sea ice has played a critical role in recent cold and snowy winters.},

Varve thicknesses relate most strongly to total annual discharge (r2=0.75, n=43, p{\textless}0.0001). Maximum annual grain size depends most strongly on maximum spring daily discharge (r2=0.63, n=43, p{\textless}0.0001) and maximum annual daily discharge (r2=0.61, n=43, p{\textless}0.0001), while varve thickness is poorly correlated with maximum annual grain size (r2=0.004, n=287, p=0.33). Relations between varve thickness and annual climate variables (temperature, precipitation, North Pacific (NP) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) indices) are insignificant. On multidecadal timescales, however, regime shifts in varve thickness and total annual discharge coincide with shifts in NP and PDO indices. Periods with increased varve thickness and total annual discharge were associated with warm PDO phases and a strengthened Aleutian Low.

fluctuations in the North Pacific on scales between
ENSO and the centennial trend and is commonly
referred to as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation or
PDO. We include a historical overview and a summary
of observational work that describes the surface,
tropospheric and subsurface signatures of this
variability. Descriptions of interdecadal
variability are incomplete at best, mostly due to
limitations in the observational record. We
emphasize that the well-known "ENSO-like" sea

eastern tropical Pacific, the SST maxima are
displaced north and south of the equator with larger
amplitudes in the northern branch near the coast of
North America, which has significant implications
for the troposphere-driven circulations. Several
mechanisms have been proposed to explain the PDO. We
review these mechanisms and models, which capture
our present level of understanding of the

abstract = {Inspired by paleoclimate evidence that much past
climate change has been symmetric about the equator,
the causes of hemispherically symmetric variability
in the recent observational record are examined
using the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction - National Center for Atmospheric
Research reanalysis dataset and numerical models. It
was found that the dominant cause of hemispherically
symmetric variability is the El Nino-Southern
Oscillation. During an El Nino event the Tropics
warm at all longitudes and the subtropical jets in
both hemispheres strengthen on their equatorward
flanks. Poleward of the tropical warming there are
latitude belts of marked cooling, extending from the
surface to the tropopause in both hemispheres, at
all longitudes and in all seasons. The midlatitude
cooling is caused by changes in the eddy-driven mean
meridional circulation. Changes in the transient
eddy momentum fluxes during an El Nino event force
upper-tropospheric ascent in midlatitudes through a
balance between the eddy fluxes and the Coriolis
torque. The eddy-driven ascent causes anomalous
adiabatic cooling, which is primarily balanced by
anomalous diabatic heating. Using a quasigeostrophic
spherical model, forced by an imposed surface eddy
disturbance of chosen wavenumber and frequency, it
is shown that the anomalous eddy momentum fluxes are
caused by the impact that the changes in the
tropically forced subtropical jets have on the
propagation in the latitude - height plane of
transient eddies. Changes in zonal winds, and
associated changes in the meridional gradient of
potential vorticity, create an anomalous region of
low meridional wavenumber in the midlatitudes that
refracts waves away both poleward and
equatorward. Tropical forcing of variability in the
eddy-driven mean meridional circulation is another
way, in addition to Rossby wave teleconnections,
whereby the Tropics can influence extratropical
climate. Unlike teleconnections this mechanism
causes climate variability that has strong zonally
and hemispherically symmetric components and
operates throughout the seasonal cycle.},

abstract = {The current Southwest drought is exceptional for its
high temperatures and arguably the most severe in
history. Coincidentally, there has been an increase
in forest and woodland mortality due to fires and
pathogenic outbreaks. Although the high temperatures
and aridity are consistent with projected impacts of
greenhouse warming, it is unclear whether the
drought can be attributed to increased greenhouse
gasses or is a product of natural climatic
variability. Climate models indicate that the 21st
century will be increasingly arid and droughts more
severe and prolonged. Forest and woodland mortality
due to fires and pathogens will increase. Demography
and food security dictate that water demand in the
Southwest will remain appreciable. If projected
population growth is twinned with suburb-centered
development, domestic demands will
intensify. Meeting domestic demands through
transference from agriculture presents concerns for
rural sustainability and food
security. Environmental concerns will limit
additional transference from rivers. It is unlikely
that traditional supply-side solutions such as more
dams will securely meet demands at current
per-capita levels. Significant savings in domestic
usage can be realized through decreased applications
of potable water to landscaping, but this is a small
fraction of total regional water use, which is
dominated by agriculture. Technical innovations,
policy measures, and market-based solutions that
increase supply and decrease water demand are all
needed. Meeting 21st-century sustainability
challenges in the Southwest will also require
planning, cooperation, and integration that surpass
20th-century efforts in terms of geographic scope,
jurisdictional breadth, multisectoral engagement,
and the length of planning timelines.},

The uncertainty in future climate due to internal climate variability can be estimated from large ensembles of climate change simulations in which the experiment setup is the same from one ensemble member to the next but for small perturbations in the initial atmospheric state. However, large ensembles are invariably computationally expensive and susceptible to model bias.Here the authors outline an alternative approach for assessing the role of internal variability in future climate based on a simple analytic model and the statistics of the unforced climate variability. The analytic model is derived from the standard error of the regression and assumes that the statistics of the internal variability are roughly Gaussian and stationary in time. When applied to the statistics of an unforced control simulation, the analytic model provides a remarkably robust estimate of the uncertainty in fut...},

scores of a gridded tree-ring reconstruction of the

with indices representing large-scale climate

to North Atlantic SST variations, indexed by the
Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). RPC3 (19{\%})
is moderately correlated with a smoothed version of
the Southern Oscillation Index. Consistent with
recent studies of instrumental data, RPC1 (PDO) and
RPC2 (AMO) explain a large part of the multidecadal
hydrologic variability of the interior western
United States. Western U. S. PDSI variability
exhibits significant pentadecadal (and longer)
oscillations in the epochs from circa 1525 to 1650

prevalent in the middle epoch from circa 1650 to

western U. S. PDSI were related to similar changes
in the PDO (and therefore in RPC1). In contrast,
RPC2 had a regular periodicity of 51 years for the
past similar to500 years. This regularity is
intriguing, and although RPC2 was primarily related
to the AMO in this study, the influence from Pacific
climate cannot be discarded.},

identified using a multivariate frequency domain
analysis. Five significant frequency bands are
isolated ranging from the quasi biennial to the
quasi decadal. Two quasi-biennial bands are centered
around 2.2- and 2.7-yr periods: two interannual
bands are centered around 3.5- and 4.4-yr periods;
the fifth band at the quasi-decadal frequency is
centered around 11.4-yr period. Between 1920 and
1955, the quasi-decadal band is less prominent
compared to the quasi-biennial bands. This happens
to be the period when SLP gradually increased over
the Greenland-Iceland regions. The spatial pattern
at the quasi-decadal frequency displays an
out-of-phase relationship in the SLP in the vicinity
of the subtropical anticyclones in both hemispheres
(indicative of an out-of-phase quasi-decadal
variability in the North and South Atlantic Hadley
circulation). The quasi-decadal frequency also
displays an out-of-phase relationship in the SSTs
north and south of the mean position of the
intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). This
short-lived structure, lasting for approximately two
years, supports the argument that a tropical SST
dipole pattern is one of the characteristics of the
quasi-decadal signal. All five frequency bands
represent to some extent fluctuations of the North
Atlantic oscillation and are associated with
tropical Atlantic Ocean warming (cooling) with
different spatial evolution. The two interannual
bands show opposite SST evolution to the south of
the ITCZ, that is, southeastward evolution from the
western tropical Atlantic for the 3.5-yr period and
westward spreading from the eastern tropical
Atlantic for the 4.4-yr period. Moreover, a
significant coherence (with a 1-yr phase lag) is
found between the SST time series along the
equatorial Atlantic obtained from the 3.5-yr period,
and the SST time series in the NINO3 area in the
Pacific. It is cautiously argued that the 3.5-yr
period is largely associated with the global El
Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon. while the
evolution of the 4.4-yr period depends more upon
Atlantic local conditions.},

The effects included are long wave radiation by water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone and the absorption of solar radiation by these three gases. The absorptivities of these gases are determined based upon the recent results of laboratory experiments and those of theoretical computations. The effects of clouds are not included. By use of this scheme the radiative equilibrium temperature is computed for various latitudes and seasons as asymptotic solutions of an initial value problem. To a certain degree the radiative equilibrium solutions reveal some of the typical characteristics of stratospheric temperature and tropopause height variations. Radiative heat budgets of the atmosphere are also computed and compared with the results of the computations of radiative equilibrium. This comparison helpful for understanding the role of radiative processes and also suggests the kinds of effect we should expect from other thermal processes in the atmosphere.},

During a period of high NAO, 1989–96, the model shows a substantial reduction of ice advection into the eastern Arctic from the Canada Basin, and an increase of ice export through Fram Strait, both of which tend to deplete thick ice in the eastern Arctic Ocean and enhance it in the western Arctic, in an uneven dipolar pattern we call the East–West Arctic Anomaly Pattern (EWAAP).

Quasi-Decadal Oscillation (QDO) observed in global
climate variability during the 20th Century (Allan,
2000) dominated tropical Indian Ocean climate
variability from 1993-2002. Both signals shared a
delayed action oscillator (DAO) similar to that
shared by corresponding signals in the tropical
Pacific Ocean (White et al., 2003), intensified in
the South Indian Ocean. Each signal was
characterized by a short-lived east-west tropical
dipole in sea level height (SLH) and sea surface
temperature (SST) variability, with the warm SST
phase in the western ocean transitioning to the cool
phase in response to slow, westward-propagating,
upwelling coupled Rossby waves in the tropical South
Indian Ocean. The cool phase in the eastern ocean
transitioning to the warm phase in response to slow,
eastward-propagating, downwelling equatorial coupled
waves. At both boundaries, the simultaneous
incidence of these coupled waves provides a delayed
negative feedback to tropical SST variability,
together producing a DAO that accounts for each
signal, similar to those observed in the Pacific
Ocean (White et al., 2003). This description allows
us to construct a DAO model of the ENSO in the
Indian Ocean that demonstrates how boundary
reflections of the coupled waves, their
intensification by wind stress forcing, and inherent
delays in their propagation yield observed frequency
and amplitude. Thus, warm SST variability in the
western tropical Indian Ocean during 1995, 1998, and
2002 arose not from zonal atmospheric
teleconnections originating with ENSO in the
tropical Pacific Ocean, but from a DAO intrinsic to
the tropical Indian Ocean that co-oscillated with
that governing ENSO in the tropical Pacific Ocean.},

Yet scant attention has been paid to designing convective representations that attempt to handle water vapor with fidelity, and even less to evaluating their performance. Here the authors attempt to address this deficiency by designing a representation of cumulus convection with close attention paid to convective water fluxes and by subjecting the scheme to rigorous tests using sounding array data. The authors maintain that such tests, in which a single-column model is forced by large-scale processes measured by or inferred from the sounding data, must be carried out over a period at least as long as the radiative-subsidence timescale—about 30 days—governing the water vapor adjustment time.

skeletal growth rates in the massive corals Pavona

Isabela Island, Galapagos, to assess interannual to
decadal climate variability in the eastern
Pacific. Comparisons of instrumental data sets show
that sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Galapagos
region are representative of a broad portion of the
eastern equatorial Pacific. The site is especially
well-suited for long-term studies of the El
Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, as it
lies within the eastern Pacific ''center of action''
for thermal anomalies associated with ENSO. The
P. gigantea isotope record is nearly monthly in
resolution, spans the period 1961-1982, and shows
strong correlation with a Galapagos instrumental SST
record (r = -0.90 for annual
averages). Cross-spectral analysis shows that SST
can explain greater than 80{\%} of the variance in
deltaO-18 at both the annual cycle and within the
high-frequency portion of the ENSO band (3-5
years). The P. clavus record is annual in
resolution, extends from 1587 to 1953 A.D., and was
obtained from a 10-m diameter colony preserved
within the Urvina Bay uplift. Because seawater
deltaO-18 variations in the region are very small,
we interpret the Urvina Bay coral deltaO-18 record
in terms of annual average SST. The isotopic record
appears to be a very good, but not perfect,
indicator of ENSO events and shows good
correspondence with the historical ENSO
reconstruction of Quinn et al. (1987). A number of
low deltaO-18 excursions that we observe during the
17th and 18th centuries very likely represent ENSO
events that are missing from the historical
tabulations. Most interannual deltaO-18 variations
between 1607 and 1953 A.D. represent annual average
temperature excursions of 1-degrees to
2.5-degrees-C. During the Little Ice Age, the annual
deltaO-18 series correlates well with many North
American tree ring records and shows low
temperatures during the early 1600s and early 1800s,
and relatively warmer conditions during the
1700s. Unlike most northern hemisphere tree ring and
instrumental records, we see no evidence at this
site for warming between 1880 and 1940 but rather

modes within the ENSO frequency band dominate the
347-year deltaO-18 time series, accounting for {\textgreater}28{\%}
of the total variance. The main ENSO mode is
centered at 4.6 years and accounts for 12{\%} of the
total variance. Additional significant oscillations
occur at periods of 3.3, 6, 8, 11, 17, 22, and 34
years. Both annual growth rate and deltaO-18 show
variance at periods equivalent to the solar and
solar magnetic periods (e.g., 11 and 22 years,
respectively). In addition, the amplitude of the
11-year deltaO-18 cycle generally varies with the
amplitude of the solar cycle, supporting previous
suggestions that the solar cycle may modulate
interannual to decadal climate variability in the
tropics. The dominant oscillatory modes, both within
the ENSO and interdecadal frequency bands, shift to
shorter periods from the early to middle 1700s and
again from the middle to late 1800s. This may
reflect major reorganizations within the tropical
ocean-atmosphere system and suggests that tropical
Pacific climate variability is linked across
timescales ranging from years to decades.},

abstract = {Precipitation over the southwestern United States
exhibits distinctive seasonality, and contrasting
ocean atmospheric dynamics are involved in the
interannual variability of cool- and warm-season
totals. Tree-ring chronologies based on annual-ring
widths of conifers in the southwestern United States
are well correlated with accumulated precipitation
and have previously been used to reconstruct cool-
season and annual precipitation totals. However,
annual-ring-width chronologies cannot typically be
used to derive a specific record of summer
monsoon-season precipitation. Some southwestern
conifers exhibit a clear anatomical transition from
the earlywood and latewood components of the annual
ring, and these exactly dated sub-annual ring
components can be measured separately and used as
unique proxies of cool- and warm-season
precipitation and their associated large-scale
ocean-atmospheric dynamics. Two 2139-yr-long
reconstructions of cool-(November-May) and
early-warm season (July) precipitation have been
developed from ancient conifers and relict wood at
El Malpais National Monument, New Mexico. Both
reconstructions have been verified on independent
precipitation data and reproduce the spatial
correlation patterns detected in the large-scale SST
and 500-mb height fields using instrumental
precipitation data from New Mexico. Above-average
precipitation in the cool- season reconstruction is
related to El Nino conditions and to the positive
phase of the Pacific decadal
oscillation. Above-average precipitation in July is
related to the onset of the North American monsoon
over New Mexico and with anomalies in the 500-mb
height field favoring moisture advection into the
Southwest from the North Pacific, the Gulf of
California, and the Gulf of Mexico. Cool- and
warm-season precipitation totals are not correlated
on an interannual basis in the 74-yr instrumental or
2139-yr reconstructed records, but wet winter-spring
extremes tend to be followed by dry conditions in
July and very dry winters tend to be followed by wet
Julys in the reconstructions. This antiphasing of
extremes could arise from the hypothesized cool- to
early-warm-season change in the sign of large-scale
ocean atmospheric forcing of southwestern
precipitation, from the negative land surface
feedback hypothesis in which winter-spring
precipitation and snow cover reduce surface warming
and delay the onset of the monsoon, or perhaps from
an interaction of both large-scale and regional
forcing. Episodes of simultaneous interseasonal
drought ("perfect'' interseasonal drought) persisted
for a decade or more during the 1950s drought of the
instrumental era and during the eighth- and
sixteenth-century droughts, which appear to have
been two of the most profound droughts over the
Southwest in the past 1400 yr. Simultaneous
interseasonal drought is doubly detrimental to
dry-land crop yields and is estimated to have
occurred during the mid-seventeenth-century famines
of colonial New Mexico but was less frequent during
the late-thirteenth-century Great Drought among the
Anasazi, which was most severe during the cool
season.},

populations have similar pollen:ovule ratios, index
of self incompatibility, stigma receptivity

barriers and the populations may share some
pollinators (Schwartz-Tzachor et al. 2006). Thus the
main potential restriction on gene flow is the
incomplete phenological barrier. These findings may
indirectly support our hypothesis that the
phenological shift is due to environmental
cues. Thus it was concluded that these two types are
'phenological ecotypes' in the sense of Turesson

An overall warming trend of 1.3°C in the ocean surface, a deepening in the depth of the mean thermocline (18 m), and increased stratification between 1950 and 1999 are found to be primarily forced by large-scale decadal fluctuations in surface heat fluxes combined with horizontal advection by the mean currents. After 1998 the surface heat fluxes suggest the beginning of a period of cooling, consistent with colder observed ocean temperatures. Salinity changes are decoupled from temperature and appear to be controlled locally in the coastal ocean by horizontal advection by anomalous currents. A cooling trend of –0.5°C in SST is...},

the central United States (CUS), denoted here as the
"warming hole," was examined in 55 simulations
driven by external historical forcings and in 19
preindustrial control (unforced) simulations from 18
coupled general circulation models
(CGCMs). Twentieth-century CUS trends were positive
for the great majority of simulations, but were
negative, as observed, for seven simulations. Only a
few simulations exhibited the observed rapid rate of
warming ( cooling) during 1901 - 40 ( 1940 -
79). Those models with multiple runs ( identical
forcing but different initial conditions) showed
considerable intramodel variability with trends
varying by up to 1.8 degrees C century(-1),
suggesting that internal dynamic variability played
a major role at the regional scale. The wide range
of trend outcomes, particularly for those models
with multiple runs, and the small number of
simulations similar to observations in both the
forced and unforced experiments suggest that the
warming hole is not a robust response of
contemporary CGCMs to the estimated external
forcings. A more likely explanation based on these
models is that the observed warming hole involves
external forcings combined with internal dynamic
variability that is much larger than typically
simulated. The observed CUS temperature variations
are positively correlated with North Atlantic (NA)
sea surface temperatures (SSTs), and both NA SSTs
and CUS temperature are negatively correlated with
central equatorial Pacific (CEP) SSTs. Most models
simulate rather well the connection between CUS
temperature and NA SSTs. However, the
teleconnections between NA and CEP SSTS and between
CEP SSTs and CUS temperature are poorly simulated
and the models produce substantially less NA SST
variability than observed, perhaps hampering their
ability to reproduce the warming hole.},

abstract = {Regulation of interannual phenological variability
is an important component of climate and ecological
models. Prior phenological efforts using the
advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) as
a proxy of vegetation dynamics have often simulated
spring events only or failed to simulate interannual
variability. Our aim is to address these
shortcomings and to use the AVHRR to develop
prognostic models for interannual land surface
phenology and, critically, to test whether or not
the developed models are superior to use of
climatological phenology values from the
AVHRR. Using datasets for the conterminous United
States, we first filtered data to select regions and
plant functional types for which the best-possible
remotely sensed signal could be obtained. We then
used a generalized linear model approach to model
the relationship between an integrative productivity
index and estimates of the start of season (SOS) and
end of season (EOS) derived from the AVHRR, yielding
models capable of prognostically predicting SOS/EOS
events independently of satellite data. Mean
absolute errors between the model-predicted and
AVHRR-observed SOS/EOS ranged from 5.1 to 20.3
days. SOS errors were uniformly lower than EOS
errors. SOS models for the deciduous broadleaf
forest and grassland plant functional types produced
lower errors than use of the climatological SOS
values while all other models produced errors higher
than those obtained from the climatological
dates. Based on this criterion for success, we
suggest that the AVHRR may not be appropriate for
further development of prognostic land surface
phenology models. However, an intercomparison of
phenological dates from an independent spring index
model, our model predictions, and the AVHRR
observations indicated that interannual predictions
from our models may be superior to the satellite
data upon which they are based, implying that a
further comparison between models based on the AVHRR
and newer, superior sensors, should be
conducted. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights

The differences between the 11 sea-ice concentration estimates-structural uncertainties-were quantified and analyzed spatially and seasonally. The algorithms differ in annual sea-ice area by 0.0-1.3 million km2 and in extent by 0.0-0.6 million km2. Linear trends for 34- and 21-year periods were calculated and compared for sea-ice concentration, area and extent. Low-frequency algorithms obtained annual Arctic sea-ice area decrease of 0.534-0.573 million km2 per decade (0.439-0.491 million km2 per decade for the extent) over the period 1979 to 2012, and a decrease of 0.866-0.975 million km2 per decade (0.767-0.812 million km2 per decade for the extent) for the 1992-2012 period. High-frequency algorithms obtained a decrease of 0.766-0.978 million km2 per decade in the area and 0.758-0.814 million km2 per decade in the extent over the period 1992-2012. Results for all the algorithms have close agreement on the strength of the negative trend in Arctic sea-ice area and extent, but are individually biased from the mean.

abstract = {The intention of this research was to explore whether dendroclimatological relationships could be used to reconstruct long-term proxy records of Little Ice Age' glacier mass balance changes in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia. Tree-ring width chronologies from the Mt Waddington area were used in concert with historical glacier records to construct models spanning the past 450 years. The approach was to build models that were based on derived relationships between tree-ring growth and glacier mass balance: (1) warmer temperatures in the summer positively influence tree growth but are detrimental to glacier health; (2) colder temperatures during the winter and deeper snowpack have a negative impact on tree growth, whereas they are related to greater accumulation on the glacier during the winter season. Stepwise regression analyses were applied to tree-ring chronologies to predict glacier mass balance at local and regional scales. The models of net annual balance for the region (regional data set) show that periods of positive mass balance occurred in the AD 1750s, 1820s to 1830s and 1970s. Peaks of winter balance correspond closely to these periods, showing a sharp drop in winter mass balance towards the end of the nineteenth century. Wavelet analyses suggest that glacial mass balance regimes in the region respond synchronously to Pacific Ocean circulation systems such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.},

America, and a westward extension of the trade winds
relative to observations. Along the equator, the
models exhibit a robust, westward-propagating annual
cycle of SST and zonal winds. During boreal spring,
excessive rainfall south of the equator is linked to
an unrealistic reversal of the simulated meridional
winds in the east, and a stronger-than-observed
semiannual signal is evident in the zonal winds and
Equatorial Undercurrent. Both CM2.0 and CM2.1 have
a robust ENSO with multidecadal fluctuations in
amplitude, an irregular period between 2 and 5 yr,
and a distribution of SST anomalies that is skewed
toward warm events as observed. The evolution of
subsurface temperature and current anomalies is also
quite realistic. However, the simulated SST
anomalies are too strong, too weakly damped by
surface heat fluxes, and not as clearly phase locked
to the end of the calendar year as in
observations. The simulated patterns of tropical
Pacific SST, wind stress, and precipitation
variability are displaced 20 degrees-30 degrees west
of the observed patterns, as are the simulated ENSO
teleconnections to wintertime 200-hPa heights over

this, the impacts of ENSO on summertime and
wintertime precipitation outside the tropical

abstract = {A 1360-yr control run from a global coupled climate
model (the Parallel Climate Model) is analyzed. it
simulates "megadroughts" in the southwestern United
States and Indian monsoon regions. The megadroughts
represent extreme events of naturally occurring
multidecadal precipitation variations linked to the
dominant pattern of multidecadal SST variability in
the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Gaining insight into
the occurrence of megadroughts thus requires an
understanding of the mechanism that is producing
this multidecadal SST variability. Analysis of the
model variability shows that the mechanism involves
atmosphere-ocean and tropical-midlatitude
interactions, with a crucial element being
wind-forced ocean Rossby waves near 20 degrees N and
25 degrees S in the Pacific whose transit times set
the decadal time scale. At the western boundary, the
Rossby waves reflect into the equatorial Pacific to
affect thermocline depth. The resulting
feedbacks. involving surface temperature. winds, and
the strength of the subtropical cells, produce SST
anomalies and associated precipitation and
convective heating anomalies. These anomalies are
associated with atmospheric Rossby waves and
resulting anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns
in the midlatitude North and South
Pacific. Consequent surface wind stress anomalies
extend equatorward into the Tropics and help force
ocean Rossby waves near 20 degrees N and 25 degrees
S. and so on. Though there are some common elements
with various ENSO processes, this decadal mechanism
is physically distinct mainly because the surface
wind stress anomalies near 20 degrees N and 25
degrees S supplement the wave reflections at the
eastern boundary to force the ocean Rossby waves
that provide the decadal time scale. These wind
anomalies are closely tied to the anomalous
midlatitude atmospheric circulation that is a
product of teleconnections from the multidecadal SST
and tropical convective heating
anomalies. themselves linked to precipitation
anomalies in the southwestern United States and
south Asia associated with megadroughts.},

This EOF analysis captures a strong linkage between the vertical component of lower-stratospheric wave activity over Eurasia and the subsequent development of hemisphere-wide surface circulation anomalies, which are strongly related to the Arctic Oscillation. Wintertime stratosphere–troposphere events picked out by this diagnostic often have a precursor in autumn: years with large October snow extent over Eurasia feature strong wintertime upward-propagating planetary wave pulses, a weaker wintertime polar vortex, and high geopotential heights in the wintertime polar troposphere.

This paper discusses the Connection Machine implementation of the model and its performance, as well as major changes that were made in the algorithms and numerical methods. In order to increase the parallel efficiency, we reformulated the barotropic equations to solve for the surface-pressure field rather than the volume-transport streamfunction. In addition to being more efficient, this method has several other advantages over the streamfunction formulation: (1) any number of islands can be included in the computational grid at no extra cost; (2) the model can handle steep gradients in the bottom topography; and (3) the free-surface height is a prognostic variable, which simplifies assimilation of altimetric data into the model. We have also developed a new parallelizable preconditioning method for the solution of the elliptic equation for the surface-pressure field. In order to use a standard conjugate gradient algorithm, an approximate-factorization technique is used to split off the Coriolis terms and obtain a symmetric operator. We then apply a symmetric local approximate-inverse operator as a preconditioning matrix, which is very effective in accelerating convergence to a solution.},

@article{meehl09,
abstract = {A new field of study, ``decadal prediction,{\{}''{\}} is
emerging in climate science. Decadal prediction lies
between seasonal/interannual forecasting and
longer-term climate change projections, and focuses
on time-evolving regional climate conditions over
the next 10-30 yr. Numerous assessments of climate
information user needs have identified this time
scale as being important to infrastructure planners,
water resource managers, and many others. It is
central to the information portfolio required to
adapt effectively to and through climatic
changes. At least three factors influence
time-evolving regional climate at the decadal time
scale: 1) climate change commitment (further warming
as the coupled climate system comes into adjustment
with increases of greenhouse gases that have already
occurred), 2) external forcing, particularly from
future increases of greenhouse gases and recovery of
the ozone hole, and 3) internally generated
variability. Some decadal prediction skill has been
demonstrated to arise from the first two of these
factors, and there is evidence that initialized
coupled climate models can capture mechanisms of
internally generated decadal climate variations,
thus increasing predictive skill globally and
particularly regionally. Several methods have been
proposed for initializing global coupled climate
models for decadal predictions, all of which involve
global time-evolving threedimensional ocean data,
including temperature and salinity. An experimental
framework to address decadal
predictability/prediction is described in this paper
and has been incorporated into the coordinated
Coupled Model Intercomparison Model, phase 5 (CMIP5)
experiments, some of which will be assessed for the
IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). These
experiments will likely guide work in this emerging
field over the next 5 yr.},

abstract = {South-central New Mexico, USA, at the junction of
the Rocky Mountains, High Plains and Chihuahuan
Desert, is one of the better known regions in the
late Quaternary of North America. Plant macrofossils
and pollen from a packrat midden series in Rough
Canyon, New Mexico allows refinement of plant
distributions and paleoclimates in this transitional
area since full glacial times. From 17000 to 12000
C-14 yr BP, Pinus edulis-Juniperus scopulorum
woodlands dominated limestone substrates between
1800 and 1490 m. with Pseudotsuga menziesii and
other mixed-conifer species restricted to shady,
north-facing slopes. Juniperus deppeana, the
dominant juniper today above 2000 m in southern New
Mexico, is conspicuously absent from glacial middens
and must have been displaced south of the US-Mexico
border. The minimum climatic conditions for
P. edulis-J. scopulorum woodlands are ca 20{\%} wetter
and 3.5-5 degreesC cooler (July mean maximum
temperatures) than the modern climate at Rough
Canyon. Holocene warming/drying may have started as
early as 12 000 C-14 yr BP with the extirpation of
J. scopulorum from Rough Canyon, and was completed
by at least 10 540 C-14 yr BP. The record for
arrivals of some desert species is confounded by
traces of pollen and macrofossils in some of the
glacial middens, which could signify either earliest
occurrence or temporal mixing (contamination) of
assemblages. AMS C-14 dating can discriminate
between early arrival and contamination in midden
macrofossils but not in pollen. AMS dates show that
Choisya dumosa, presently near its northern (cold)
limits at Rough Canyon, endured late glacial
winters, possibly as clonal populations. Some Larrea
tridentata leaves and pollen occur in middens
dominated by conifers and oaks no longer at the
site; an AMS date of 3205 C-14 yr BP on Larrea
leaves from one midden indicates
contamination. Evidence for some macrofossil
contamination, however, does not rule out the
possibility that pollen of desert elements
(e.g. Larrea, Prosopis) in late glacial-early
Holocene middens indicates their presence in the
Tularosa Basin, well ahead of their local appearance
in Rough Canyon. Finally, the increasing dominance
of desert elements after 5000 C-14 yr BP in the
Rough Canyon series and elsewhere in the northern
Chihuahuan Desert could reflect slow, postglacial
migration from the south and/or progressive
encroachment with gradual stripping of soils formed
during the last glacial period. (C) 2001 Elsevier

abstract = {A regional climate model, the Weather Research and
Forecasting (WRF) Model, is forced with increased
atmospheric CO2 and anomalous SSTs and lateral
boundary conditions derived from nine coupled
atmosphere-ocean general circulation models to
produce an ensemble set of nine future climate
simulations for northern Africa at the end of the
twenty-first century. A well validated control
simulation, agreement among ensemble members, and a
physical understanding of the future climate change
enhance confidence in the predictions. The regional
model ensembles produce consistent precipitation
projections over much of northern tropical Africa. A
moisture budget analysis is used to identify the
circulation changes that support future
precipitation anomalies. The projected midsummer
drought over the Guinean Coast region is related
partly to weakened monsoon flow. Since the rainfall
maximum demonstrates a southward bias in the control
simulation in July-August, this may be indicative of
future summer drying over the Sahel. Wetter
conditions in late summer over the Sahel are
associated with enhanced moisture transport by the
West African westerly jet, a strengthening of the
jet itself, and moisture transport from the
Mediterranean. Severe drought in East Africa during
August and September is accompanied by a weakened
Indian monsoon and Somali jet. Simulations with
projected and idealized SST forcing suggest that
overall SST warming in part supports this regional
model ensemble agreement, although changes in SST
gradients are important over West Africa in spring
and fall. Simulations which isolate the role of
individual climate forcings suggest that the spatial
distribution of the rainfall predictions is
controlled by the anomalous SST and lateral boundary
conditions, while CO2 forcing within the regional
model domain plays an important secondary role and
generally produces wetter conditions.},

Our results indicate that during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (900-1300 AD) the Pacific Northwest experienced exceptional wetness in winter and that during the Little Ice Age (LIA) (1450-1850 AD) conditions were drier, contrasting with hydroclimatic anomalies in the desert Southwest and consistent with climate dynamics related to the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

Parallel experiments with different ocean model configurations (full-depth, slab, and no interactive ocean) allow the roles of dynamical and thermodynamic ocean feedbacks to be isolated. In the absence of ocean coupling, the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice loss is confined to north of 30°N, consisting of a weakening and equatorward shift of the westerlies accompanied by lower tropospheric warming and enhanced precipitation at high latitudes. With ocean feedbacks, the response expands to cover the whole globe and exhibits a high degree of equatorial symmetry: the entire troposphere warms, the global hydrological cycle strengthens, and the intertropical convergence zones shift equatorward.

abstract = {[1] A Porites coral collected from Xisha Island,
South China Sea, represents a skeleton secreted in
the period from 1906 to 1994. The Sr contents of the
coral vary linearly with the instrument-measured
sea-surface temperature (SST), giving a Sr
thermometer: SST = - 1.9658 x Sr + 193.26. The
reconstructed SST data show that the late 20th
century was warmer (about 1 degreesC) than the early
20th century and that two cooling (1915/1916 and
1947/1948) and three warming (1935/1936, 1960/1961,
and 1976/1977) shifts occurred in the century. The
temperature shifts are more pronounced for winters,
implying a close effect of the west Pacific warm
pool and Asian monsoon and suggesting that the
former is a primary force controlling the climatic
system of the region. Results of this study and
previously published data indicate a close link of
temperature shifts between the boreal summer and the
austral winter or the boreal winter and the austral
summer. The annual SST anomalies in the South China
Sea and the South Pacific reveal the existence of
harmonic but opposite SST variations between the two
regions. On the decadal scale the comparative annual
SST anomalies for the South China Sea and for the
equatorial west Pacific show a similarity in
temperature variations, implying that the South
China Sea climate is coherent with climatic regime
of the tropical west Pacific.},

This paper describes developments to all CCSM components, and documents fully coupled preindustrial control runs compared to the previous version, CCSM3. Using the standard atmosphere and land resolution of 1° results in the sea surface temperature biases in the major upwelling regions being comparable to the 1.4°-resolution CCSM3. Two changes to the deep convection scheme in the atmosphere component result in CCSM4 producing El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation variability with a much more realistic frequency distribution than in CCSM3, although the amplitude is too large compared to observations. These changes also improve the Madden–Julian oscillation and the frequency distribution of tropical precipitation.

significance of these changes remain poorly
understood - in part because we lack an
understanding of the natural variability. Here we
show that the phase of the annual cycle of surface
temperature over extratropical land shifted towards
earlier seasons by 1.7 days between 1954 and 2007;
this change is highly anomalous with respect to
earlier variations, which we interpret as being
indicative of the natural range. Significant changes
in the amplitude of the annual cycle are also
observed between 1954 and 2007. These shifts in the
annual cycles appear to be related, in part, to
changes in the northern annular mode of climate
variability, although the land phase shift is
significantly larger than that predicted by trends
in the northern annular mode alone. Few of the
climate models presented by the Intergovernmental

abstract = {Time series of alkenone unsaturation indices gathered along the California margin reveal large (4 degrees to 8 degrees C) glacial-interglacial changes in sea surface temperature (SST) over the past 550,000 years. Interglacial times with SSTs equal to or exceeding that of the Holocene contain peak abundances in the pollen of redwood, the distinctive component of the temperate rainforest of the northwest coast of California. In the region now dominated by the California Current, SSTs warmed 10,000 to 15,000 years in advance of deglaciation at each of the past five glacial maxima. SSTs did not rise in advance of deglaciation south of the modern California Current front. Glacial warming along the California margin therefore is a regional signal of the weakening of the California Current during times when large ice sheets reorganized wind systems over the North Pacific. Both the timing and magnitude of the SST estimates suggest that the Devils Hole (Nevada) calcite record represents regional but not global paleotemperatures, and hence does not pose a fundamental challenge to the orbital ("Milankovitch") theory of the Ice Ages.},

abstract = {Equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the ultimate change in global mean temperature in response to a change in external forcing. Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming.},

of dendroclimatic reconstructions of summer drought
patterns over the conterminous US back to AD
1700. The new reconstructions are based on a set of
483 drought-sensitive tree-ring chronologies
available across the continental US. In contrast
with the 'point-by-point' (PPR) local regression
technique used previously, the tree-ring data were
calibrated against the instrumental record of summer
drought (June-August Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI)) based on application of the 'Regularized
Expectation Maximization' ('RegEM') algorithm to
relate large-scale patterns of variation in proxy
and instrumental data over a common (twentieth
century) interval. A screening procedure was first
used to select an optimal subset of candidate
tree-ring drought predictors, and the predictors
(tree-ring data) and predictand (instrumental PDSI)
were prewhitened prior to calibration, with serial
correlation added back into the reconstruction at
the end of the procedure. The PDSI field was
separated into eight relatively homogenous regions
of summer drought through a cluster analysis, and
three distinct calibration schemes were
investigated: (i) 'global' (i.e., entire
conterminous US domain) proxy data calibrated
against 'global' PDSI; (ii) regional proxy data
calibrated against regional PDSI; and (iii) global
proxy data calibrated against regional PDSI. The
greatest cross-validated skill was evident for case
(iii), suggesting the existence of useful non-local
information in the tree-ring predictor
set. Cross-validation results based on withheld late
nineteenth/early twentieth-century instrumental
data, as well as a regionally limited extension of
cross-validation results back to the mid-nineteenth
century based on long available instrumental series,
indicate a modest improvement in reconstructive
skill over the PPR approach. At the continental
scale, the 1930s 'Dust Bowl' remains the most severe
drought event since 1700 within the context of the
estimated uncertainties, but more severe episodes
may have occurred at regional scales in past
centuries.},

abstract = {Variations in fire regimes can be inferred from
changes in the abundance of sedimentary charcoal
found in lake and bog sediments. When analysed with
pollen data, inferences can be made about past
vegetation dynamics and climate as well. The
analysis of high-resolution charcoal records
generally involves the decomposition of charcoal
influx into (a) a slowly varying 'background'
component that provides information about long-term
changes in regional fire activity, biomass and/or
depositional processes, and (b) a 'peaks' component
that represents local fire events. In this study, 15
high-resolution charcoal records from the
northwestern USA and associated pollen data were
examined to describe the variations and controls of
charcoal influx and background trends. Late-Holocene
charcoal influx levels at each site were compared
with late-Holocene sedimentation rates, vegetation
and fire frequency, and with modern climate and
physical site characteristics to better understand
the spatial variability in charcoal
abundance. Charcoal abundance was largely determined
by physical site characteristics (eg, lake and
watershed size) and the proportion of woody
taxa. Background trends displayed regional
similarities, - closely with woody taxa proportions
in and the subcontinental scale trend based on all
records correlated the pollen spectra. Background
charcoal and woody taxa proportions increased
together from minima in the Late Glacial to maxima
in the late Holocene. The strong similarity in these
trends suggests that background charcoal influx is a
function of fuel characteristics, which in turn are
governed by climate and vegetation. Variations in
sedimentation rate and fire frequency had little
influence on background charcoal trends.},

@article{trenberth98,
abstract = {The primary focus of this review is
tropical-extratropical interactions and especially
the issues involved in determining the response of
the extratropical atmosphere to tropical forcing
associated with sea surface temperature (SST)
anomalies. The review encompasses observations,
empirical studies, theory and modeling of the
extratropical teleconnections with a focus on
developments over the Tropical Oceans-Global
Atmosphere (TOGA) decade and the current state of
understanding. In the tropical atmosphere, anomalous
SSTs force anomalies in convection and large-scale
overturning with subsidence in the descending branch
of the local Hadley circulation. The resulting
strong upper tropospheric divergence in the tropics
and convergence in the subtropics act as a Rossby
wave source. The climatological stationary planetary
waves and associated jet streams, especially in the
northern hemisphere, can make the total Rossby wave
sources somewhat insensitive to the position of the
tropical heating that induces them and thus can
create preferred teleconnection response patterns,
such as the Pacific-North American (PNA)
pattern. However, a number of factors influence the
dispersion and propagation of Rossby waves through
the atmosphere, including zonal asymmetries in the
climatological state, transients, and baroclinic and
nonlinear effects. Internal midlatitude sources can
amplify perturbations. Observations, modeling, and
theory have clearly shown how storm tracks change in
response to changes in quasi-stationary waves and
how these changes generally feedback to.maintain or
strengthen the dominant perturbations through
vorticity and momentum transports. The response of
the extratropical atmosphere naturally induces
changes in the underlying surface, so that there are
changes in extratropical SSTs and changes in land
surface hydrology and moisture availability that can
feedback and influence the total response. Land
surface processes are believed to be especially
important in spring and summer. Anomalous SSTs and
tropical forcing have tended to be strongest in the
northern winter, and teleconnections in the southern
hemisphere are weaker and more variable and thus
more inclined to be masked by natural
variability. Occasional strong forcing in seasons
other than winter can produce strong and
identifiable signals in the northern hemisphere and,
because the noise of natural variability is less,
the signal-to-noise ratio can be Large. The relative
importance of tropical versus extratropical SST
forcings has been established through numerical
experiments with atmospheric general circulation
models (AGCMs). Predictability of anomalous
circulation and associated surface temperature and
precipitation in the extratropics is somewhat
limited by the difficulty of finding a modest signal
embedded in the high level of noise from natural
variability in the extra;tropics, and the complexity
and variety of the possible feedbacks. Accordingly,
ensembles of AGCM runs and time averaging are needed
to identify signals and make predictions. Strong
anomalous tropical forcing provides opportunities
for skillful forecasts, and the accuracy and
usefulness of forecasts is expected to improve as
the ability to forecast the anomalous SSTs improves,
as models improve, and as the information available
from the mean and the spread of ensemble forecasts
is better utilized.},

two indices: (i) SST anomalies in the Nino-3.4

given by the difference in normalized anomalies of

the equatorial Pacific east of the date line and the
second index is the gradient in SST across the same

orthogonal. TNI leads N3.4 by 3 to 12 months prior
to the climate shift in 1976/77 and also follows
N3.4 but with opposite sign 3 to 12 months
later. However, after 1976/77, the sign of the TNI

time series are generally altered by the presence of
errors in timing, i.e., when applied to

timing. Most previous work on this subject has
sought to maximize some goodness of fit between

through more quantitative methods. However, there is
a danger that unrelated records can be made to

a statistical test for the presence of covariance

probability of obtaining a maximum covariance from
randomly realized time-uncertain series is assessed
using the theory of order statistics. The results of
this analytical method provide insight into the
influence of timing errors upon covariance and are
shown to be consistent with results derived from a
Monte Carlo procedure. We apply this methodology to
evaluate the covariance between a time-uncertain

reflect native-species responses and atmospheric

diverse climates, and within a group of stations in
the state of Oklahoma, which has moderate climate
variations across an east-to-west gradient. The
results show that the onset of spring in
midlatitudes is a modally abrupt (rather than
gradual) seasonal transition in terms of energy
balance (sensible and latent heat levels) and
carbon-flux change that can be linked directly to
vegetation phenology. The consistent temporal
pattern and magnitude of flux variations across
diverse sites suggest that this technique has
potential as a proxy for spring energy-balance

space-time structure of multidecadal sea surface
temperature (SST) variability can be explained by

flux variability associated with regional
atmospheric variability patterns is integrated by
the large heat capacity of the extra-tropical

variance towards longer timescales. Atmospheric
teleconnections spread the extratropical signal to
the tropical regions. Once SST anomalies have
developed in the Tropics, global atmospheric
teleconnections spread the signal around the world

suggests that hyper climate modes can vary on

Principal component analysis shows that two significant and independent patterns explain roughly half of the total variance in the timing of spring onset from 1920 to 2005. However, these patterns of spring onset do not appear to be linear responses to the primary modes of variability in the Northern Hemisphere: the Pacific–North American pattern (PNA) and the northern annular mode (NAM). Instead, over the period when reanalysis data and the spring index model overlap (1950–2005), the patterns of spring onset are local responses to the state of both the PNA and NAM, which together modulate the onset date of spring by 10–20 days on interannual time scales. They do so by controlling the number and intensity of warm days. There is also a regionwide trend in spring advancement of...},

abstract = {The CSIRO Mark 2 coupled global climatic model has
been used to generate a 10,000-year simulation for
'present' climatic conditions. The model output has
been analysed to identify sustained climatic
fluctuations, such as those attributed to the
Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age
(LIA). Since no external forcing was permitted
during the model run all such fluctuations are
attributed to naturally occurring climatic
variability associated with the nonlinear processes
inherent in the climatic system. Comparison of
simulated climatic time series for different
geographical locations highlighted the lack of
synchronicity between these series. The model was
found to be able to simulate climatic extremes for
selected observations for century timescales, as
well as identifying the associated spatial
characteristics. Other examples of time series
simulated by the model for the USA and eastern
Russia had similar characteristics to those
attributed to the MWP and the LIA, but smaller
amplitudes, and clearly defined spatial patterns. A
search for the frequency of occurrence of specified
surface temperature anomalies, defined via duration
and mean value, revealed that these were primarily
confined to polar regions and northern latitudes of
Europe, Asia and North America. Over the majority of
the oceans and southern hemisphere such climatic
fluctuations could not be sustained, for reasons
explained in the paper. Similarly, sustained sea-ice
anomalies were mainly confined to the northern
hemisphere. An examination of mechanisms associated
with the sustained climatic fluctuations failed to
identify a role for the North Atlantic Oscillation,
the El Nino-Southern Oscillation or the Pacific
Decadal Oscillation. It was therefore concluded that
these fluctuations were generated by stochastic
processes intrinsic to the nonlinear climatic
system. While a number of characteristics of the MWP
and the LIA could have been partially caused by
natural processes within the climatic system, the
inability of the model to reproduce the observed
hemispheric mean temperature anomalies associated
with these events indicates that external forcing
must have been involved. Essentially the unforced
climatic system is unable to sustain the generation
of long-term climatic anomalies.},

abstract = {Stable water isotopes have been measured in a wide
range of climate archives, with the purpose of
reconstructing regional climate variations. Yet the
common assumption that the isotopic signal is a
direct indicator of temperature proves to be
misleading under certain circumstances, since its
relationship with temperature also depends on
e.g. atmospheric circulation and precipitation
seasonality. Here we introduce the principles,
benefits and caveats of using climate models with
embedded water isotopes as a support for the
interpretation of isotopic climate archives. A short
overview of the limitations of empirical
calibrations of isotopic proxy records is
presented. In some cases, the underlying hypotheses
are not fulfilled and the calibration contradicts
the physical interpretation of isotopic
fractionation. The simulation of climate and its
associated isotopic signal, despite difficulties
related to downscaling and intrinsic atmospheric
variability, can provide a 'transfer function'
between the isotopic signal and the considered
climate variable. The relationship between modelled
temperature and isotopic signal is analysed under
present-day, pre-industrial and mid-Holocene
conditions. The linear regression relationship is
statistically more significant for
precipitation-weighted annual temperature than mean
annual temperature, yet the regression slope varies
greatly between the time-slice
experiments. Temperature reconstructions that do not
account for the slope variations will in this case
underestimate the low-frequency variability and
overestimate high-frequency variability from the
isotopic proxy record. The spatial variability of
the simulated delta O-18-temperature slope further
indicates that the isotopic signal is primarily
controlled by synoptic atmospheric circulation
rather than local temperature.},

abstract = {Assessing carbon sink-source relationships in
peatlands must be based on the understanding of
processes responsible for long-term carbon
accumulation patterns. In contrast with ombrogeneous
bogs, however, the processes in geogeneous fens are
poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution
Holocene peat accumulation and macrofossil data from
a rich fen (Upper Pinto Fen (UPF)) in west-central
Alberta, Canada. The similar to8000-year chronology
of a 397 cm peat core was controlled by 20
accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dates. The
paludified peatland initially consisted of diverse
brown moss species and some Larix trees but was
dominated by Scorpidium scorpioides from 6500 to
1300 calibrated years BR The last 1300 years are
characterized by the reappearance of Larix together
with abundant woody materials and Cyperaccae,
culminating in a sharp increase in Tomenthypnum
nitens in the last several decades. During the
Scorpidium-dominated period, the peat accumulation
pattern derived from 15 14 C dates and 260 bulk
density measurements indicates declining mass
accumulation rates over time (i.e., convex age-depth
curve), in contrast with the standard bog growth
model (i.e., concave curve). The analysis of the UPF
data using an extended model incorporating variable
peat addition rates (PAR) to the catotelm suggests a
unidirectional sevenfold decrease in PAR from 191.8
to 26.0 g dry mass.m(-2).year(-1) during the similar
to5000-year "convex period". Decreasing vegetation
production and (or) increasing acrotelm
decomposition could have produced the convex
pattern. Decreasing PAR might be owing to
autogenically induced changes in local hydrology and
nutrient availability, which are pronounced in the
moisture-limited climate of the region and in
peatlands that have a strong groundwater
influence. The convex-pattern model, explicit to the
height-induced long-term drying hypothesis, has
important implications for building simulation
models and for projecting future carbon dynamics of
peatlands. Prior to recent human disturbance, the
UPF site has a time-weighted mean carbon
accumulation rate of 31.1 g C.m(-2).year(-1),
ranging from 7.2 to 182.5 g C.m(-2).year(-1) during
the last 8000 years. This large variation results
from the gradual decline of long-term accumulation
and short-term climate-induced accumulation
"pulses". The results imply that in the absence of
climatic change, peatlands with a convex
accumulation pattern will reach their growth limit
sooner and that their carbon sequestration capacity
will decline faster than would be expected given the
concave-pattern model.},

The program also enables the use of other popular standardisation methods. A series of experiments is described in which the ability of simple RCS and SF RCS to recover known tree-growth forcing signals is tested. In the comparatively rare situation where many sub-fossil data are distributed over a wide time range and there is no slope in the overall common-growth forcing signal, simple RCS is satisfactory. Simple RCS produces distortion in all other examples explored here. SF RCS is superior to simple RCS and in all cases examined. SF RCS works well except when the span of starting dates of sample trees is too narrow, a situation for which a test is available. Based on the results of the tests explored here, we conclude that Signal-Free RCS should be used as the standard method of RCS processing.},

to be the source region of a substantial proportion
of the world's inter-annual climate variability,

Oscillation. Here new data are presented on changes
in the climate of this region over the past 70 yr,
based on analysis of the stable oxygen isotopic
composition of annually banded, massive corals
living on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. In
this area, the coincidence of abundant and
isotopically light rainfall with small seasonal and
inter-annual changes in temperature means that the
coral skeletal delta(18)O record may be reliably
interpreted in terms of rainfall variation. Since
the abundance of rainfall is governed by the
intensity of deep atmospheric convection, the coral
records provide regionally significant, and
regionally reproducible, climatic indices. In
particular, the coral records indicate larger
changes in the degree of coupling of the climate of
the region with the Southern Oscillation than have
hitherto been described. These changes in coupling,
which accompany shifts in the dominant periodicities
of inter-annual climate variation, are indicative of
rapid and large-scale reorganisation of
ocean-atmosphere interactions. The data indicate
that from the 1920s to 1950s the western equatorial
Pacific was less important in modulating Pacific and
global inter-annual climatic variability than it has
appeared to be subsequently. The reproducibility of
the coral climate records, combined with the
presence on the north coast of Papua New Guinea of
extensive and well preserved raised reef terraces,
leads to the potential for extending understanding
of climatic variability in this globally important

options available for marginal change of existing
agricultural systems, often variations of existing
climate risk management. We show that implementation
of these options is likely to have substantial
benefits under moderate climate change for some
cropping systems. However, there are limits to their
effectiveness under more severe climate
changes. Hence, more systemic changes in resource
allocation need to be considered, such as targeted
diversification of production systems and

adaptation action will necessitate integration of
climate change-related issues with other risk
factors, such as climate variability and market
risk, and with other policy domains, such as
sustainable development. Dealing with the many
barriers to effective adaptation will require a
comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering a
range of scales and issues, for example, from the
understanding by farmers of change in risk profiles
to the establishment of efficient markets that
facilitate response strategies. Science, too, has to
adapt. Multidisciplinary problems require
multidisciplinary solutions, i.e., a focus on

unravelling the mechanisms that have influenced
monsoon variability and teleconnections has proven

precipitation intensified even more rapidly from

Models show this reduction largely offsets global mean surface temperature increases due to quadrupled CO2 concentrations and prevents 97{\%} of the Arctic sea ice loss that would otherwise occur under high CO2 levels but, compared to the preindustrial climate, leaves the tropics cooler (−0.3 K) and the poles warmer (+0.8 K). Annual mean precipitation minus evaporation anomalies for G1 are less than 0.2 mm day−1 in magnitude over 92{\%} of the globe, but some tropical regions receive less precipitation, in part due to increased moist static stability and suppression of convection.

@article{trenberth_and_branstator92,
abstract = {Progress toward understanding the causes of and
physical mechanisms involved in the 1988 North
American drought is reported. An earlier study
demonstrated that major sea surface temperature
(SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean, in
association with the 1988 La Nina, may have
disrupted atmospheric heating patterns by changing
the location and intensity of the intertropical
convergence zone and that such heating anomalies
could have initiated the circulation anomalies
across North America responsible for the drought. A
key issue of when the drought circulation anomalies
developed and their relation to changes in tropical
Pacific SSTs is examined. Although unusually dry
soil moisture and heat waves persisted into August,
the anomalous atmospheric conditions that brought on
the drought occurred in April, May, and June of
1988. The evolution of the Pacific SSTs and tropical
convection, as revealed by outgoing longwave
radiation, is shown to be consistent with the
development of the conditions favorable for
initiating the drought circulation pattern in April
through June of 1988. On the equator at
110-degrees-W, SST anomalies exceeded
-2.75-degrees-C in only April, May, and June and
were largest (-4.1-degrees-C) in May 1988. The
issues of how the 1988 La Nina differed from those
in the past and the importance of the whole SST
field in determining the anomalous diabatic heating
are also discussed. Diagnostic calculations of
atmospheric diabatic heating confirm that
atmospheric heating anomalies existed in the
tropical Pacific in association with the major SST
anomalies during this time. The link between the
anomalous heating and the tropical SSTs supports the
view that influences external to the atmosphere were
important and that the drought was not generated
solely by mechanisms internal to the atmosphere. The
distribution of diagnosed heating anomalies over
North America, together with a planetary wave model
response to idealized forcing, is described to
clarify the possible role of soil moisture anomalies
in perpetuating the drought. It is argued that
feedback-caused soil moisture anomalies may have
been secondary sources for the drought circulation
but could not have been the primary instigator. For
the most part, other diagnosed heating anomalies
during the drought are found to have little
influence on the North American region. Criteria to
help judge the ability of general circulation models
to simulate the drought are discussed.},

wintertime sea-level pressure field is more strongly
coupled to surface air temperature fluctuations over
the Eurasian continent than the North Atlantic

respects; but its primary center of action covers
more of the Arctic, giving it a more zonally
symmetric appearance. Coupled to strong fluctuations

interannual, and interdecadal time scales, this
``Arctic Oscillation{\{}''{\}} (AO) can be interpreted as
the surface signature of modulations in the strength
of the polar vortex aloft. It is proposed that the
zonally asymmetric surface air temperature and
mid-tropospheric circulation anomalies observed in
association with the AO may be secondary baroclinic
features induced by the land-sea contrasts. The same
modal structure is mirrored in the pronounced trends
in winter and springtime surface air temperature,
sea-level pressure, and 50-hPa height over the past
30 years: parts of Eurasia have warmed by as much as
several K, sea-level pressure over parts of the
Arctic has fallen by 4 hPa, and the core of the
lower stratospheric polar vortex has cooled by
several K. These trends can be interpreted as the
development of a systematic bias in one of the

It is shown that changes in August/September sea ice concentration impact on tropospheric and stratospheric geopotential heights in the following winter. During low ice phases a negative tropospheric Arctic Oscillation pattern is found, which is connected to a weakened stratospheric polar vortex and warmer stratospheric temperatures. Furthermore, the analysis reveals enhanced upward EP fluxes due to planetary waves for low ice conditions. Strong stratospheric anomalies in the Atlantic/European region are associated with a weaker polar vortex. Low ice periods are connected with additional tropospheric wave energy excitation in the Pacific/North America region and influence the stratosphere through three-dimensional planetary wave propagation.

abstract = {According to tree ring and other records, a series
of severe droughts that lasted for decades afflicted
western North America during the Medieval period
resulting in a more arid climate than in subsequent
centuries. A review of proxy evidence from around
the world indicates that North American megadroughts
were part of a global pattern of Medieval
hydroclimate that was distinct from that of
today. In particular, the Medieval hydroclimate was
wet in northern South America, dry in mid-latitude
South America, dry in eastern Africa but with strong
Nile River floods and a strong Indian monsoon. This
pattern is similar to that accompanying persistent
North American droughts in the instrumental
era. This pattern is compared to that associated
with familiar climate phenomena. The best fit comes
from a persistently La Ni (n) over tildea-like
tropical Pacific and the warm phase of the so-called
Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. A positive North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) also helps to explain the
Medieval hydroclimate pattern. Limited sea surface
temperature reconstructions support the contention
that the tropical Pacific was cold and the
subtropical North Atlantic was warm, ideal
conditions for North American drought. Tentative
modeling results indicate that a multi-century La Ni
(n) over tildea-like state could have arisen as a
coupled atmosphere-ocean response to high irradiance
and weak volcanism during the Medieval period and
that this could in turn have induced a persistently
positive NAO state. A La Ni (n) over tildea-like
state could also induce a strengthening of the North
Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and
hence warming of the North Atlantic Ocean, by (i)
the ocean response to the positive NAO and by
shifting the southern mid-latitude westerlies
poleward which (ii) will increase the salt flux from
the Indian Ocean into the South Atlantic and (iii)
drive stronger Southern Ocean upwelling. (C) 2007

abstract = {It is argued from SST observations for the period
1950-90 that the tropical Indo-Pacific
ocean-atmosphere system may be described as a stable
linear dynamical system driven by spatially coherent
Gaussian white noise. Evidence is presented that the
predictable component of SST anomaly growth is
associated with the constructive interference of
several damped normal modes after an optimal initial
structure is set up by the white noise forcing. In
particular, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
growth is associated with an interplay of at least
three damped normal modes, with periods longer than
two years and decay times of 4 to 8 months, rather
than the manifestation of a single unstable mode
whose growth is arrested by
nonlinearities. Interestingly, the relevant modes
are; not the three least damped modes of the
system. Rather, mode selection, and the
establishment of the optimal initial structure from
which growth occurs, are controlled by the
stochastic forcing. Experiments conducted with an
empirical stochastic-dynamical model show that
stochastic forcing not only adds energy to the
system, but also plays a role in setting up the
optimal structure. It is shown that growth from
modal interference can occur for as long as 18
months, which within the confines of this model
defines a predictability limit for growth
events. Growth associated with the stochastic
forcing is also possible, but is unpredictable. The
timescale on which the predictable and unpredictable
components of SST growth become comparable to each
other gives a more conservative predictability limit
of 15 months. The above scenario is based on
empirical evidence obtained from SST anomalies
alone. From the results of several tests based on
statistical properties of linear and nonlinear
dynamical systems, one may conclude that much of the
ENSO cycle in nature is dominated by stable, forced
dynamics.},

@article{hansen05_efficacy,
abstract = {[1] We use a global climate model to compare the
effectiveness of many climate forcing agents for
producing climate change. We find a substantial
range in the "efficacy'' of different forcings,
where the efficacy is the global temperature
response per unit forcing relative to the response
to CO2 forcing. Anthropogenic CH4 has efficacy
similar to 110{\%}, which increases to similar to
145{\%} when its indirect effects on stratospheric H2O
and tropospheric O-3 are included, yielding an
effective climate forcing of similar to 0.8 W/m(2)
for the period 1750 - 2000 and making CH4 the
largest anthropogenic climate forcing other than
CO2. Black carbon (BC) aerosols from biomass burning
have a calculated efficacy similar to 58{\%}, while
fossil fuel BC has an efficacy similar to
78{\%}. Accounting for forcing efficacies and for
indirect effects via snow albedo and cloud changes,
we find that fossil fuel soot, defined as BC + OC (
organic carbon), has a net positive forcing while
biomass burning BC + OC has a negative forcing. We
show that replacement of the traditional
instantaneous and adjusted forcings, Fi and Fa, with
an easily computed alternative, Fs, yields a better
predictor of climate change, i.e., its efficacies
are closer to unity. Fs is inferred from flux and
temperature changes in a fixed-ocean model
run. There is remarkable congruence in the spatial
distribution of climate change, normalized to the
same forcing Fs, for most climate forcing agents,
suggesting that the global forcing has more
relevance to regional climate change than may have
been anticipated. Increasing greenhouse gases
intensify the Hadley circulation in our model,
increasing rainfall in the Intertropical Convergence
Zone (ITCZ), Eastern United States, and East Asia,
while intensifying dry conditions in the subtropics
including the Southwest United States, the
Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and an
expanding Sahel. These features survive in model
simulations that use all estimated forcings for the
period 1880 - 2000. Responses to localized forcings,
such as land use change and heavy regional
concentrations of BC aerosols, include more specific
regional characteristics. We suggest that
anthropogenic tropospheric O-3 and the BC snow
albedo effect contribute substantially to rapid
warming and sea ice loss in the Arctic. As a
complement to a priori forcings, such as Fi, Fa, and
Fs, we tabulate the a posteriori effective forcing,
Fe, which is the product of the forcing and its
efficacy. Fe requires calculation of the climate
response and introduces greater model dependence,
but once it is calculated for a given amount of a
forcing agent it provides a good prediction of the
response to other forcing amounts.},

abstract = {Observations and simulations link anthropogenic
greenhouse and aerosol emissions with rapidly
increasing Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures
(SSTs). Over the past 60 years, the Indian Ocean
warmed two to three times faster than the central
tropical Pacific, extending the tropical warm pool
to the west by similar to 40A degrees longitude ({\textgreater}
4,000 km). This propensity toward rapid warming in
the Indian Ocean has been the dominant mode of
interannual variability among SSTs throughout the
tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans (55A degrees
E-140A degrees W) since at least 1948, explaining
more variance than anomalies associated with the El
Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In the atmosphere,
the primary mode of variability has been a
corresponding trend toward greatly increased
convection and precipitation over the tropical
Indian Ocean. The temperature and rainfall increases
in this region have produced a westward extension of
the western, ascending branch of the atmospheric
Walker circulation. Diabatic heating due to
increased mid-tropospheric water vapor condensation
elicits a westward atmospheric response that sends
an easterly flow of dry air aloft toward eastern
Africa. In recent decades (1980-2009), this response
has suppressed convection over tropical eastern
Africa, decreasing precipitation during the
'long-rains' season of March-June. This trend toward
drought contrasts with projections of increased
rainfall in eastern Africa and more 'El Nio-like'
conditions globally by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change. Increased Indian Ocean SSTs
appear likely to continue to strongly modulate the
Warm Pool circulation, reducing precipitation in
eastern Africa, regardless of whether the projected
trend in ENSO is realized. These results have
important food security implications, informing
agricultural development, environmental
conservation, and water resource planning.},

However, through hypothesis testing, it was found that some interregional variability exists in the magnitude of various sounding parameters that the authors felt characterized the important aspects of the thermodynamic profile of freezing-rain environments. This variability seems to be related not only to local effects resulting from terrain variations and nearby water sources, but also from regional differences in synoptic-scale atmospheric environments favorable for freezing rain.

abstract = {Understanding natural causes of climate change is
vital to evaluate the relative impacts of human
pollution and land surface modification on
climate. We have investigated one of the most
important natural causes of climate change, volcanic
eruptions, by using 54 ice core records from both
the Arctic and Antarctica. Our recently collected
suite of ice core data, more than double the number
of cores ever used before, reduces errors inherent
in reconstructions based on a single or small number
of cores, which enables us to obtain much higher
accuracy in both detection of events and
quantification of the radiative effects. We
extracted volcanic deposition signals from each ice
core record by applying a high-pass loess filter to
the time series and examining peaks that exceed
twice the 31-year running median absolute
deviation. We then studied the spatial pattern of
volcanic sulfate deposition on Greenland and
Antarctica and combined this knowledge with a new
understanding of stratospheric transport of volcanic
aerosols to produce a forcing data set as a function
of month, latitude, and altitude for the past 1500
years. We estimated the uncertainties associated
with the choice of volcanic signal extraction
criteria, ice core sulfate deposition to
stratospheric loading calibration factor, and the
season for the eruptions without a recorded
month. We forced an energy balance climate model
with this new volcanic forcing data set, together
with solar and anthropogenic forcing, to simulate
the large-scale temperature response. The results
agree well with instrumental observations for the
past 150 years and with proxy records for the entire
period. Through better characterization of the
natural causes of climate change, this new data set
will lead to improved prediction of anthropogenic
impacts on climate. The new data set of
stratospheric sulfate injections from volcanic
eruptions for the past 1500 years, as a function of
latitude, altitude, and month, is available for

abstract = {Nobody anticipated that El Nino would be weak and
prolonged in 1992, but brief and intense in
1997/98. Why are various El Nino episodes so
different, and so difficult to predict? The answer
involves the important role played by random
atmospheric disturbances (such as westerly wind
bursts) in sustaining the weakly damped Southern
Oscillation, whose complementary warm and cold
phases are, respectively, El Nino and La Nina. As in
the case of a damped pendulum sustained by modest
blows at random times, so the predictability of El
Nino is limited, not by the amplification of errors
in initial conditions as in the case of weather, but
mainly by atmospheric disturbances interacting with
the Southern Oscillation. Given the statistics of
the wind fluctuations, the probability distribution
function of future sea surface temperature
fluctuations in the eastern equatorial Pacific can
be determined by means of an ensemble of
calculations with a coupled ocean-atmosphere
model. Each member of the ensemble starts from the
same initial conditions and has, superimposed, a
different realization of the noise. Such a
prediction, made at the end of 1996, would have
assigned a higher likelihood to a moderate event
than to the extremely strong event that actually
occurred in 1997. (The rapid succession of several
westerly wind bursts in early 1997 was a relatively
rare phenomenon.) In late 2001, conditions were
similar to those in 1996, which suggested a
relatively high probability of El Nino appearing in
2002. Whether the event will be weak or intense
depends on the random disturbances that materialize
during the year.},

abstract = {Satellite observations reveal a substantial decline in September Arctic sea ice extent since 1979, which has played a leading role in the observed recent Arctic surface warming and has often been attributed, in large part, to the increase in greenhouse gases. However, the most rapid decline occurred during the recent global warming hiatus period. Previous studies are often focused on a single mechanism for changes and variations of summer Arctic sea ice extent, and many are based on short observational records. The key players for summer Arctic sea ice extent variability at multidecadal/centennial time scales and their contributions to the observed summer Arctic sea ice decline are not well understood. Here a multiple regression model is developed for the first time, to the author's knowledge, to provide a framework to quantify the contributions of three key predictors (Atlantic/Pacific heat transport into the Arctic, and Arctic Dipole) to the internal low-frequency variability of Summer Arctic sea ice extent, using a 3,600-y-long control climate model simulation. The results suggest that changes in these key predictors could have contributed substantially to the observed summer Arctic sea ice decline. If the ocean heat transport into the Arctic were to weaken in the near future due to internal variability, there might be a hiatus in the decline of September Arctic sea ice. The modeling results also suggest that at multidecadal/centennial time scales, variations in the atmosphere heat transport across the Arctic Circle are forced by anticorrelated variations in the Atlantic heat transport into the Arctic.},

abstract = {Among the least understood interactions between physics and biology in the oceans are those that take place on the decadal scale. But this temporal scale is important because some of the greatest ecological events take place on this time scale. More than 50 years of measurement in the California Current System have revealed significant ecosystem changes, including a large, decadal decline in zooplankton biomass, along with a rise in upper-ocean temperature. The temperature change was a relatively abrupt shift around 1976-77, concurrent with other basin-wide changes associated with an intensification of the Aleutian Low-pressure system. This intensification generates temperature anomalies in the ocean by altering the patterns of net surface-heat fluxes, turbulent mixing, and horizontal transport. Changes in the mean abundance of zooplankton in the southern California Current have been attributed to variations in the strength of coastal upwelling, variations in the horizontal transport of nutrient-rich water from the north, or increased stratification due to warming, all of which could be affected by fluctuations in the Aleutian Low. Here we show that a deepening of the thermocline accompanied the warming and increased the stratification of the water column, leading to a decrease in the supply of plant nutrients to the upper layers. This is the most likely mechanism for the observed plankton decline, and subsequent ecosystem changes. A global change in upper-ocean heat content, accompanied by an increase in stratification and mixed-layer deepening relative to the critical depth for net production, could lead to a widespread decline in plankton abundance.},

precipitation anomalies in North America are related
to changes in the paths of storm systems across the
Pacific Ocean, with a more southern route into
southwestern North America during El Ninos and a
more northern route into the Pacific Northwest
during La Ninas. Daily reanalysis data are analyzed
to confirm these changes. Seasonal mean upper
tropospheric eddy statistics show, for El Ninos (La
Ninas), a pattern that is shifted southward
(northward) compared with climatology. Paths of
coherent phase propagation of transient eddies and
of the propagation of wave packets are analyzed. A
coherent path of propagation across the Pacific
towards North America is identified that is more
zonal during El Nino winters and, during La Ninas,
has a dominant path heading northeastward to the
Pacific Northwest. A second path heading
southeastward from the central Pacific to the
tropical east Pacific is more accentuated during La
Ninas than El Ninos. These changes in wave
propagation are reproduced in an ensemble of
seasonal integrations of a general circulation model
forced by a tropical Pacific sea-surface temperature
pattern, confirming that the changes are forced by
changes in the mean atmospheric state arising from
changes in tropical sea-surface temperature. A
simplified model with a specified basic state is
used to model the storm tracks for El Nino and La
Nina winters. The results suggest that the changes
in transient eddy propagation and the eddy
statistics can be understood in terms of the
refraction of transient eddies within different

abstract = {[1] Among other longer-than-22-year periods in
Fourier spectra of various solar-terrestrial
records, the 88-year cycle is unique, because it can
be directly linked to the cyclic activity of sunspot
formation. Variations of amplitude as well as of
period of the Schwabe 11-year cycle of sunspot
activity have actually been known for a long time
and a ca. 80-year cycle was detected in those
variations. Manifestations of such secular periodic
processes were reported in a broad variety of solar,
solar-terrestrial, and terrestrial climatic
phenomena. Confirmation of the existence of the
Gleissberg cycle in long solar terrestrial records
as well as the question of its stability is of great
significance for solar dynamo theories. For that
perspective, we examined the longest detailed
cosmogenic isotope record-INTCAL98 calibration
record of atmospheric C-14 abundance. The most
detailed precisely dated part of the record extends
back to 11, 854 years B. P. During this whole
period, the Gleissberg cycle in C-14 concentration
has a period of 87.8 years and an average amplitude
of similar to1parts per thousand (in Delta(14)C
units). Spectral analysis indicates in frequency
domain by sidebands of the combination tones at
periods of approximate to91.5 +/- 0.1 and
approximate to84.6 +/- 0.1 years that the amplitude
of the Gleissberg cycle appears to be modulated by
other long-term quasiperiodic process of timescale
similar to2000 years. This is confirmed directly in
time domain by bandpass filtering and time-frequency
analysis of the record. Also, there is additional
evidence in the frequency domain for the modulation
of the Gleissberg cycle by other millennial scale
processes. Attempts have been made to explain 20th
century global warming exclusively by the component
of irradiance variation associated with the
Gleissberg cycle. These attempts fail, because they
require unacceptably great solar forcing and are
incompatible with the paleoclimatic records.},

the Saskatchewan region of western Canada are

abstract = {Abstract A multi-millenial simulation with a coupled
atmospheric-oceanic climatic model has been used to
investigate the occurrence rate and characteristics
of multi-year dry and pluvial episodes. Such
episodes are defined as having the same sign
rainfall anomalies for the whole of their
durations. Episodes of 5-, 8- and 10-year durations
are shown to occur all over the globe. The
occurrence rates are approximately in agreement with
probabilistic expectations, although there are
spatial variations associated with El Nino Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) influences. The impacts of the
dry and pluvial episodes are considerable, with
10-year duration dry episodes resulting in a loss of
at least one year's rainfall over the oceans and
much larger losses over arid regions. Similar but
positive outcomes are associated with pluvial
episodes. Accumulated rainfall anomalies over
various multi-decadal periods indicate that regions
with persistent features can occur, implying longer
term impacts than might have been expected from a
succession of dry and pluvial episodes. Time series
of these episodes for individual model gridboxes
highlight a disparity between the occurrence rates
of dry and pluvial episodes and the lack of
synchronicity of these episodes at the various
gridboxes. These time series also clearly illustrate
the rapid fall-off in the occurrence rates of the
episodes as their durations are increased. Despite
claims in the literature that `megadroughts' are
typically associated with extended ENSO events, it
is shown that for a very extended La Nina event the
rainfall anomalies in a number of ENSO-sensitive
regions experienced interannual variability rather
than a persistent anomaly. The role of a number of
large-scale oscillations in generating rainfall
anomalies is examined, but it is concluded that
stochastic processes are needed to account for the
extended duration of dry and pluvial episodes, in
addition to any forcing associated with such
oscillations. This adds a random aspect to the
determination of whether any given, say, ENSO event
will become a dry or pluvial episode.},

abstract = {The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) project is
an international effort to produce a comprehensive
global atmospheric circulation dataset spanning the
twentieth century, assimilating only surface
pressure reports and using observed monthly
sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions as
boundary conditions. It is chiefly motivated by a
need to provide an observational dataset with
quantified uncertainties for validations of climate
model simulations of the twentieth century onall
time-scales, with emphasis on the statistics of
daily weather. It uses an Ensemble Kalman Filter
data assimilation method with background 'first
guess' fields supplied by an ensemble of forecasts
from a global numerical weather prediction
model. This directly yields a global analysis every
6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere,
and also an uncertainty estimate of that analysis.
The 20CR dataset provides the first estimates of
global tropospheric variability, and of the
dataset's time-varying quality, from 1871 to the
present at 6-hourly temporal and 2 degrees spatial
resolutions. Intercomparisons with independent
radiosonde data indicate that the reanalyses are
generally of high quality. The quality in the
extratropical Northern Hemisphere throughout the
century is similar to that of current three-day
operational NWP forecasts. Intercomparisons over the
second half-century of these surface-based
reanalyses with other reanalyses that also make use
of upper-air and satellite data are equally
encouraging. It is anticipated that the 20CR
dataset will be a valuable resource to the climate
research community for both model validations and
diagnostic studies. Some surprising results are
already evident. For instance, the long-term trends
of indices representing the North Atlantic
Oscillation, the tropical Pacific Walker
Circulation, and the Pacific-North American pattern
are weak or non-existent over the full period of
record. The long-term trends of zonally averaged
precipitation minus evaporation also differ in
character from those in climate model simulations of
the twentieth century. Copyright (C) 2011 Royal

mean Great Plains precipitation using an ensemble of
century-long atmospheric general circulation model
(AGCM) simulations forced with observed sea surface

predictability (intraensemble spread) of the
precipitation response to SST forcing varies on
interannual and longer time scales. In particular,
this study finds that pluvial conditions are more
predictable (have less intraensemble spread) than
drought conditions. This rather unexpected result is
examined in the context of the physical mechanisms
that impact precipitation in the Great Plains. These
mechanisms include El Nino-Southern Oscillation's
impact on the planetary waves and hence the Pacific
storm track (primarily during the cold season), the
role of Atlantic SSTs in forcing changes in the
Bermuda high and low-level moisture flux into the
continent (primarily during the warm season), and
soil moisture feedbacks (primarily during the warm
season). It is found that the changes in
predictability are primarily driven by changes in
the strength of the land-atmosphere coupling, such
that under dry conditions a given change in soil
moisture produces a larger change in evaporation and
hence precipitation than the same change in soil
moisture would produce under wet soil
conditions. The above changes in predictability are
associated with a negatively skewed distribution in
the seasonal mean precipitation during the warm
season-a result that is not inconsistent with the
observations.},

During the Arctic winter, a variation of downward longwave radiation (DLR) is fundamental in modulating Arctic surface temperature. In the warm Arctic winter, DLR and precipitable water (PW) are increasing over the entire Arctic; however, the major drivers for such increases differ regionally. In areas such as the northern Greenland Sea, increasing DLR and PW are caused mainly by convergence of atmospheric energy transport from lower latitudes. In regions of maximum sea-ice retreat (e.g., northern Barents–Kara seas), continued sea-ice melting from previous seasons drive the DLR and PW increases, consistent with the positive ice-insulation feedback. Distinct local feedbacks between open-water and ice-retreat regions were further compared. In open-water regions, a reduced ocean–atmosphere temperat...},

abstract = {Climate change impact studies for water resource
applications, such as the development of projections
of reservoir yields or the assessment of likely
frequency and amplitude of drought under a future
climate, require that the year-to-year persistence
in a range of hydrological variables such as
catchment average rainfall be properly
represented. This persistence is often attributable
to low-frequency variability in the global sea
surface temperature (SST) field and other
large-scale climate variables through a complex
sequence of teleconnections. To evaluate the
capacity of general circulation models (GCMs) to
accurately represent this low-frequency variability,
a set of wavelet-based skill measures has been
developed to compare GCM performance in representing
interannual variability with the observed global SST
data, as well as to assess the extent to which this
variability is imparted in precipitation and surface
pressure anomaly fields. A validation of the derived
skill measures is performed using GCM precipitation
as an input in a reservoir storage context, with the
accuracy of reservoir storage estimates shown to be
improved by using GCM outputs that correctly
represent the observed low-frequency variability.
Significant differences in the performance of
different GCMs is demonstrated, suggesting that
judicious selection of models is required if the
climate impact assessment is sensitive to
low-frequency variability. The two GCMs that were
found to exhibit the most appropriate representation
of global low-frequency variability for individual
variables assessed were the Istituto Nazionale di
Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) ECHAM4 and
L'Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace Coupled Model,
version 4 (IPSL CM4); when considering all three
variables, the Max Planck Institute (MPI) ECHAM5
performed well. Importantly, models that represented
interannual variability well for SST also performed
well for the other two variables, while models that
performed poorly for SST also had consistently low
skill across the remaining variables.},

abstract = {Convective quasi-equilibrium (QE) has for several decades stood as a key postulate for parametrization of the impacts of moist convection at small scales upon the large-scale flow. Departures from QE have motivated stochastic convective parametrization, which in its early stages may be viewed as a sensitivity study. Introducing plausible stochastic terms to modify the existing convective parametrizations can have substantial impact, but, as for so many aspects of convective parametrization, the results are sensitive to details of the assumed processes. We present observational results aimed at helping to constrain convection schemes, with implications for each of conventional, stochastic or 'superparametrization' schemes. The original vision of QE due to Arakawa fares well as a leading approximation, but with a number of updates. Some, like the imperfect connection between the boundary layer and the free troposphere, and the importance of free-tropospheric moisture to buoyancy, are quantitatively important but lie within the framework of ensemble-average convection slaved to the large scale. Observations of critical phenomena associated with a continuous phase transition for precipitation as a function of water vapour and temperature suggest a more substantial revision. While the system's attraction to the critical point is predicted by QE, several fundamental properties of the transition, including high precipitation variance in the critical region, need to be added to the theory. Long-range correlations imply that this variance does not reduce quickly under spatial averaging; scaling associated with this spatial averaging has potential implications for superparametrization. Long tails of the distribution of water vapour create relatively frequent excursions above criticality with associated strong precipitation events.},

indicated several promising approaches to
alleviating these biases. This paper describes the

parameterizations for canopy integration, canopy
interception, frozen soil, soil water availability,

surface and subsurface runoff, a groundwater model

introduction of a factor to simulate nitrogen

set of offline simulations were compared with
observed data for runoff, river discharge, soil
moisture, and total water storage to assess the
performance of the new model (referred to as

its partitioning of global evapotranspiration (ET)
which result in wetter soils, less plant water
stress, increased transpiration and photosynthesis,
and an improved annual cycle of total water
storage. Phase and amplitude of the runoff annual
cycle is generally improved. Dramatic improvements
in vegetation biogeography result when CLM3.5 is
coupled to a dynamic global vegetation model. Lower

or pluvials, over western North America are examined
in model simulations of the period from 1856 to
2000. The simulations used either (i) global sea
surface temperature data as a lower boundary
condition or (ii) observed data in just the tropical
Pacific and computed the surface ocean temperature
elsewhere with a simple ocean model. With both
arrangements, the model was able to simulate many
aspects of the low-frequency (periods greater than 6
yr) variations of precipitation over the Great
Plains and in the American Southwest including much
of the nineteenth-century variability, the droughts
of the 1930s (the "Dust Bowl") and 1950s, and the
very wet period in the 1990s. Results indicate that
the persistent droughts and pluvials were ultimately
forced by persistent variations of tropical Pacific
surface ocean temperatures. It is argued that ocean
temperature variations outside of the tropical
Pacific, but forced from the tropical Pacific, act
to strengthen the droughts and pluvials. The
persistent precipitation variations are part of a
pattern of global variations that have a strong
hemispherically and zonally symmetric component,
which is akin to interannual variability, and that
can be explained in terms of interactions between
tropical ocean temperature variations, the
subtropical jets, transient eddies, and the
eddy-driven mean meridional circulation. Rossby wave
propagation poleward and eastward from the tropical
Pacific heating anomalies disrupts the zonal
symmetry, intensifying droughts and pluvials over
North America. Both mechanisms of tropical driving
of extratropical precipitation variations work in
summer as well as winter and can explain the
year-round nature of the precipitation
variations. In addition, land-atmosphere
interactions over North America appear important by
(i) translating winter precipitation variations into
summer evaporation and, hence, precipitation
anomalies and (ii) shifting the northward flow of
moisture around the North Atlantic subtropical
anticyclone eastward from the Plains and Southwest
to the eastern seaboard and western Atlantic Ocean.},

abstract = {Fluctuations in spring climate in the western United
States over the last 4-5 decades are described by
examining changes in the blooming of plants and the
timing of snowmelt-runoff pulses. The two measures
of spring's onset that are employed are the timing
of first bloom of lilac and honeysuckle bushes from
a long-term cooperative phenological network, and
the timing of the first major pulse of snowmelt
recorded from high-elevation streams. Both measures
contain year-to-year fluctuations, with typical
year-to year fluctuations at a given site of one to
three weeks. These fluctuations are spatially
coherent, forming regional patterns that cover most
of the west. Fluctuations in lilac first bloom dates
are highly correlated to those of honeysuckle, and
both are significantly correlated with those of the
spring snowmelt pulse. Each of these measures, then,
probably respond to a common mechanism. Various
analyses indicate that anomalous temperature exerts
the greatest influence upon both interannual and
secular changes in the onset of spring in these
networks. Earlier spring onsets since the late 1970s
are a remarkable feature of the records, and reflect
the unusual spell of warmer-than-normal springs in
western North America during this period. The warm
episodes are clearly related to larger-scale
atmospheric conditions across North America and the
North Pacific, but whether this is predominantly an
expression of natural variability or also a symptom
of global warming is not certain.},

abstract = {Using experiments with an atmospheric general
circulation model, the climate impacts of a
basin-scale warming or cooling of the North Atlantic
Ocean are investigated. Multidecadal fluctuations
with this pattern were observed during the twentieth
century, and similar variations-but with larger
amplitude-are believed to have occurred in the more
distant past. It is found that in all seasons the
response to warming the North Atlantic is strongest,
in the sense of highest signal-to-noise ratio, in
the Tropics. However there is a large seasonal cycle
in the climate impacts. The strongest response is
found in boreal summer and is associated with
suppressed precipitation and elevated temperatures
over the lower-latitude parts of North and South
America. In August-September-October there is a
significant reduction in the vertical shear in the
main development region for Atlantic hurricanes. In
winter and spring, temperature anomalies over land
in the extratropics are governed by dynamical
changes in circulation rather than simply reflecting
a thermodynamic response to the warming or cooling
of the ocean. The tropical climate response is
primarily forced by the tropical SST anomalies, and
the major features are in line with simple models of
the tropical circulation response to diabatic
heating anomalies. The extratropical climate
response is influenced both by tropical and
higher-latitude SST anomalies and exhibits nonlinear
sensitivity to the sign of the SST
forcing. Comparisons with multidecadal changes in
sea level pressure observed in the twentieth century
support the conclusion that the impact of North
Atlantic SST change is most important in summer, but
also suggest a significant influence in lower
latitudes in autumn and winter. Significant climate
impacts are not restricted to the Atlantic basin,
implying that the Atlantic Ocean could be an
important driver of global decadal variability. The
strongest remote impacts are found to occur in the
tropical Pacific region in June-August and
September-November. Surface anomalies in this region
have the potential to excite coupled
ocean-atmosphere feedbacks, which are likely to play
an important role in shaping the ultimate climate
response.},

Simple theories suggest that global warming will reduce the strength of the mean tropical atmospheric circulation. An important aspect of this tropical circulation is a large-scale zonal (east-west) overturning of air across the equatorial Pacific Ocean--driven by convection to the west and subsidence to the east--known as the Walker circulation. Here we explore changes in tropical Pacific circulation since the mid-nineteenth century using observations and a suite of global climate model experiments. Observed Indo-Pacific sea level pressure reveals a weakening of the Walker circulation. The size of this trend is consistent with theoretical predictions, is accurately reproduced by climate model simulations and, within the climate models, is largely due to anthropogenic forcing. The climate model indicates that the weakened surface winds have altered the thermal structure and circulation of the tropical Pacific Ocean. These results support model projections of further weakening of tropical atmospheric circulation during the twenty-first century.},

abstract = {Soils are subject to varying degrees of direct or indirect human disturbance, constituting a major global change driver. Factoring out natural from direct and indirect human influence is not always straightforward, but some human activities have clear impacts. These include land use change, land management, and land degradation (erosion, compaction, sealing and salinization). The intensity of land use also exerts a great impact on soils, and soils are also subject to indirect impacts arising from human activity, such as acid deposition (sulphur and nitrogen) and heavy metal pollution. In this critical review, we report the state-of-the-art understanding of these global change pressures on soils, identify knowledge gaps and research challenges, and highlight actions and policies to minimise adverse environmental impacts arising from these global change drivers. Soils are central to considerations of what constitutes sustainable intensification. Therefore, ensuring that vulnerable and high environmental value soils are considered when protecting important habitats and ecosystems, will help to reduce the pressure on land from global change drivers. To ensure that soils are protected as part of wider environmental efforts, a global soil resilience programme should be considered, to monitor, recover or sustain soil fertility and function, and to enhance the ecosystem services provided by soils. Soils cannot, and should not, be considered in isolation of the ecosystems that they underpin and vice versa. The role of soils in supporting ecosystems and natural capital needs greater recognition. The lasting legacy of the International Year of Soils in 2015 should be to put soils at the centre of policy supporting environmental protection and sustainable development.

abstract = {A suite of historical atmospheric model simulations is described that uses a hierarchy of global boundary forcings designed to inform research on the detection and attribution of weather and climate-related extremes. In addition to experiments forced by actual variations in sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration, and atmospheric chemical composition (so-called Factual experiments); additional (Counterfactual) experiments are conducted in which the boundary forcings are adjusted by removing estimates of long-term climate change. A third suite of experiments are identical to the Factual runs except that sea ice concentrations are set to climatological conditions (Clim-Polar experiments). These were used to investigate the cause for extremely warm Arctic surface temperature during 2016. Much of the magnitude of surface temperature anomalies averaged poleward of 65°N in 2016 (3.2 ± 0.6 °C above a 1980–89 reference) is shown to have been forced by observed global boundary conditions. The Factual experiments reveal that at least three quarters of the magnitude of 2016 annual mean Arctic warmth was forced, with considerable sensitivity to assumptions of sea ice thickness change. Results also indicate that 30–40{\%} of the overall forced Arctic warming signal in 2016 originated from drivers outside of the Arctic. Despite such remote effects, the experiments reveal that the extreme magnitude of the 2016 Arctic warmth could not have occurred without consideration of the Arctic sea ice loss. We find a near-zero probability for Arctic surface temperature to be as warm as occurred in 2016 under late-19th century boundary conditions, and also under 2016 boundary conditions that do not include the depleted Arctic sea ice. Results from the atmospheric model experiments are reconciled with coupled climate model simulations which lead to a conclusion that about 60{\%} of the 2016 Arctic warmth was likely attributable to human-induced climate change.},

from mid-latitude lakes. Prior to 15,000 cat yr BP,
the vegetation was characterized by steppe
vegetation with isolated stands of Nothofagus. The
climate was generally dry, and the sparse vegetation
apparently lacked sufficient fuels to bum
extensively. After 15,000 cat yr BP, a mixture of
Nothofagus forest and shrubland/steppe
developed. Fire activity increased between 13,250
and 11,400 cat yr BP, contemporaneous with a
regionally defined cold dry period (Huelmo/Maseardi
Cold Reversal). The early-Holocene period was
characterized by an open Nothofagus forest/shrubland
mosaic, and fire frequency was high in dry sites and
low in wet sites; the data suggest a sharp decrease
in moisture eastward from the Andes. A shift to a
surface-fire regime occurred at 7500 cat yr BP at
the wet site and at 4400 cat yr BP at the dry site,
preceding the expansion of Austrocedrus by 1000-1500
yr. The spread of Austrocedrus is explained by a
shift towards a cooler and wetter climate in the
middle and late Holocene. The change to a
surface-fire regime is consistent with increased
interannual climate variability and the onset or
strengthening of ENSO. The present-day mixed forest
dominated by Nothofagus and Austrocedrus was
established in the last few millennia. (c) 2006

We find that large spread in the projected timing of the September ice-free Arctic in 30 CMIP5 models is associated at least as much with different atmospheric model components as with initial conditions. Here we reduce the spread in the timing of an ice-free state using two different approaches for the 30 CMIP5 models: (i) model selection based on the ability to reproduce the observed sea ice climatology and variability since 1979 and (ii) constrained estimation based on the strong and persistent relationship between present and future sea ice conditions. Results from the two approaches show good agreement. Under a high-emission scenario both approaches project that September ice extent will drop to ∼1.7 million km(2) in the mid 2040s and reach the ice-free state (defined as 1 million km(2)) in 2054-2058. Under a medium-mitigation scenario, both approaches project a decrease to ∼1.7 million km(2) in the early 2060s, followed by a leveling off in the ice extent.},

abstract = {Current vegetation models hold constant the dynamics
of seasonal biospheric changes, neglecting annual
variability. One of these features, the spring
"green wave" (onset of leafing or "green-up") in
midlatitudes, is an example of the complex feedback
loop between the atmosphere and plant communities.
The green wave responds to the atmosphere, but, in
turn, leafing causes rapid changes in the
surface-layer energy budget. Annual variability
tends to obscure the magnitude of the green wave's
effects on conventional climatic records. When
meteorological data are "normalized" to the green
wave (averaged relative to first-leaf phenology data
rather than to calendar date), an actual break in
the spring maximum temperature curve can be
detected. This project examined many surface-level
meteorological variables (at standard shelter
height, representing surface-layer conditions)
during the time of spring leafing in order to detect
other changes and to further analyze the cause,
extent, and persistence of these annual
variations. The results show that the green wave
occurs in conjunction with discontinuities (signals)
in lower-atmospheric lapse rate, surface vapor
pressure, relative humidity, visibility, and V wind
component. These signals are consistent with the
start of plant photosynthetic activity, seasonal
shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns, and
physical changes in the nature of the surface
layer. A parameter from simple green-wave models
that identifies seasonal changes in the lower
atmosphere may be useful in operational forecasting
and GCM simulations that link the atmosphere and
biosphere.},

abstract = {The North American monsoon is a seasonal shift of
upper- and low-level pressure and wind patterns that
brings summertime moisture into the southwest United
States and ends the late spring wet period in the
Great Plains. The interannual variability of the
North American monsoon is examined using the
NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (1948-98). The diurnal and
seasonal evolution of 500-mb geopotential height,
integrated moisture flux, and integrated moisture
flux convergence are constructed using a 5-day
running mean for the months May through
September. All of the years are used to calculate an
average daily Z score that removes the diurnal,
seasonal, and intraseasonal variability. The 30-day
average Z score centered about the date is
correlated with Pacific sea surface temperature
anomaly (SSTA) indices associated with the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North
Pacific oscillation (NPO). These indices are Nino-3,
a North Pacific index, and a Pacific index that
combines the previous two. Regional time-evolving
precipitation indices for the Southwest and Great
Plains, which consider the total number of wet or
dry stations in a region, are also correlated with
the SSTA indices. The use of nonnormally distributed
point source precipitation data is avoided.
Teleconnections are computed relative to the
climatological evolution of the North American
monsoon, rather than to calendar months, thus more
accurately accounting for the climatological changes
in the large-scale circulation. Tropical and North
Pacific SSTs are related to the occurrence of the
Pacific Transition and East Pacific teleconnection
patterns, respectively, in June and July. A high
(low) NPO phase and El Nino (La Nina) conditions
favor a weaker (stronger) and southward (northward)
displaced monsoon ridge. These teleconnection
patterns affect the timing and large-scale
distribution of monsoon moisture. In the Great
Plains, the spring wet season is lengthened
(shortened) and early summer rainfall and integrated
moisture flux convergence are above (below)
average. In the Southwest, monsoon onset is late
(early) and early summer rainfall and integrated
moisture flux convergence are below (above)
average. Relationships with Pacific SSTA indices
decay in the later part of the monsoon coincident
with weakening of the jet stream across the Pacific
and strengthening of the monsoon ridge over North
America. The most coherent summer climate patterns
occur over the entire western United States when the
Pacific index is substantially high or low, such as
during the Midwest flood of 1993 and drought of
1988. The Pacific index in spring is a good
predictor of early summer height anomalies over the
western United States when the time evolution of the
North Pacific SST dipole is considered.},

To determine the physical processes contributing to these changes in the Arctic pack ice, model results from a regional coupled ice–ocean model have been analyzed. Since 1988 the thickness of the simulated basinwide ice thinned by 1.31 m or 43{\%}. The thinning is greatest along the coast in the sector from the Chukchi Sea to the Beaufort Sea to Greenland. It is hypothesized that the thinning since 1988 is due to preconditioning, a trigger, and positive feedbacks: 1) the fall, winter, and spring air temperatures over the Arctic Ocean have gradually increased over the last 50 yr, leading to reduced thickness of first-year ice at the start of summer; 2) a temporary shift, starting in 1989, of two principal climate indexes (the Arctic Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation) caused a flushing of some of the older, thicker ice out of the basin and...},

@article{stenchikov02,
abstract = {[1] Observations show that strong equatorial
volcanic eruptions have been followed by a
pronounced positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation
(AO) for one or two Northern Hemisphere winters. It
has been previously assumed that this effect is
forced by strengthening of the equator-to-pole
temperature gradient in the lower stratosphere,
caused by aerosol radiative heating in the
tropics. To understand atmospheric processes that
cause the AO response, we studied the impact of the
1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, which produced the
largest global volcanic aerosol cloud in the
twentieth century. A series of control and
perturbation experiments were conducted with the
GFDL SKYHI general circulation model to examine the
evolution of the circulation in the 2 years
following the Pinatubo eruption. In one set of
perturbation experiments, the full radiative effects
of the observed Pinatubo aerosol cloud were
included, while in another only the effects of the
aerosols in reducing the solar flux in the
troposphere were included, and the aerosol heating
effects in the stratosphere were suppressed. A third
set of perturbation experiments imposed the
stratospheric ozone losses observed in the
post-Pinatubo period. We conducted ensembles of four
to eight realizations for each case. Forced by
aerosols, SKYHI produces a statistically significant
positive phase of the AO in winter, as
observed. Ozone depletion causes a positive phase of
the AO in late winter and early spring by cooling
the lower stratosphere in high latitudes,
strengthening the polar night jet, and delaying the
final warming. A positive phase of the AO was also
produced in the experiment with only the
tropospheric effect of aerosols, showing that
aerosol heating in the lower tropical stratosphere
is not necessary to force positive AO response, as
was previously assumed. Aerosol-induced tropospheric
cooling in the subtropics decreases the meridional
temperature gradient in the winter troposphere
between 30degreesN and 60degreesN. The corresponding
reduction of mean zonal energy and amplitudes of
planetary waves in the troposphere decreases wave
activity flux into the lower stratosphere. The
resulting strengthening of the polar vortex forces a
positive phase of the AO. We suggest that this
mechanism can also contribute to the observed
long-term AO trend being caused by greenhouse gas
increases because they also weaken the tropospheric
meridional temperature gradient due to polar
amplification of warming.},

Here, it is argued that environmental prediction systems for the polar regions are less developed than elsewhere. There are many reasons for this situation, including the polar regions being (historically) lower priority, with fewer in situ observations, and with numerous local physical processes that are less well represented by models.

recent study by Fedorov et al. has drawn attention
to the effects of a freshening on the other main
component of the oceanic circulation-the swift,
shallow, wind-driven circulation that varies on
decadal time scales and is closely associated with
the ventilated thermocline. That circulation too
involves meridional overturning, but its variations

such a degree that temperatures along the equator

temperature gradient virtually disappears, and
permanently warm conditions prevail in the
Tropics. In a model that has both the wind-driven

We present a new method to constrain such GCM simulations of SIT via a statistical bias correction technique. The bias correction successfully constrains the spatial SIT distribution and temporal variability in the CMIP5 projections whilst retaining the climatic fluctuations from individual ensemble members. The bias correction acts to reduce the spread in projections of SIT and reveals the significant contributions of climate internal variability in the first half of the century and of scenario uncertainty from the mid-century onwards. The projected date of ice-free conditions in the Arctic under the RCP8.5 high emission scenario occurs in the 2050s, which is a decade earlier than without the bias correction, with potentially significant implications for stakeholders in the Arctic such as the shipping industry.

abstract = {Severe drought is arguably one of the greatest
recurring natural disasters that strikes North
America. A synthesis of multiproxy data shows that
North America was in the grip of a severe
centennial-scale drought during medieval times
(800-1300 AD). In this study, the Community
Atmospheric Model ( CAM) is used to investigate the
role of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies from
the North Atlantic and the tropical Pacific Ocean on
this megadrought. These anomalies are obtained from
proxy reconstructions of SST. Four model experiments
with prescribed SST anomalies in the tropical
Pacific and/or North Atlantic Ocean were made. The
CAM results captured the major dry features that
occurred during medieval times in North America. The
cold tropical Pacific alone can simulate essentially
the drought intensity, while the warm North Atlantic
alone can simulate the drought areal extent. The two
working together can explain the severity and
longevity of the drought. During the spring season,
the cool tropical Pacific, or the warm North
Atlantic, or both, results in less moisture
transport to the High Plains, with a 15-40{\%}
decrease in rainfall. The importance of the Atlantic
Ocean on medieval drought in North America suggests
that attention should be paid not only to the
tropical Pacific Ocean but also to the North
Atlantic Ocean in understanding the North America
drought variability and predictability, both at
present and during the past. This is especially true
because the Pacific Ocean SST anomalies in medieval
times as recorded by proxy data are somewhat
controversial, while the North Atlantic anomalies
seem more certain.},

abstract = {Climate variability exists at all timescales - and
climatic processes are intimately coupled, so that
understanding variability at any one timescale
requires some understanding of the whole. Records of
the Earth's surface temperature illustrate this
interdependence, having a continuum of variability
following a power-law scaling(1-7). But although
specific modes of interannual variability are
relatively well understood(8,9), the general
controls on continuum variability are uncertain and
usually described as purely stochastic
processes(10-13). Here we show that power-law
relationships of surface temperature variability
scale with annual and Milankovitch-period (23,000-
and 41,000- year) cycles. The annual cycle
corresponds to scaling at monthly to decadal
periods, while millennial and longer periods are
tied to the Milankovitch cycles. Thus the annual,
Milankovitch and continuum temperature variability
together represent the response to deterministic
insolation forcing. The identification of a
deterministic control on the continuum provides
insight into the mechanisms governing interannual
and longer-period climate variability.},

Indeed, this effort is required to meet the specific tailored regional prediction and decision support needs of a large community of climate information users. The multimodel ensemble approach has proven extremely effective at quantifying prediction uncertainty due to uncertainty in model formulation and has proven to produce better prediction quality (on average) than any single model ensemble. This multimodel approach is the basis for several international collaborative prediction research efforts and an operational European system, and there are numerous examples of how this multimodel ensemble approach yields superior forecasts compared to any single model.

abstract = {The most comprehensive large-scale characterization of the global sea ice cover so far has been provided by satellite passive microwave data. Accurate retrieval of ice concentrations from these data is important because of the sensitivity of surface flux (e.g., heat, salt, and water) calculations to small changes in the amount of open water (leads and polynyas) within the polar ice packs. Two algorithms that have been used for deriving ice concentrations from multichannel data are compared. One is the NASA Team algorithm and the other is the Bootstrap algorithm, both of which were developed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The two algorithms use different channel combinations, reference brightness temperatures, weather filters, and techniques. Analyses are made to evaluate the sensitivity of algorithm results to variations of emissivity and temperature with space and time. To assess the difference in the performance of the two algorithms, analyses were performed with data from both hemispheres and for all seasons. The results show only small differences in the central Arctic in winter but larger disagreements in the seasonal regions and in summer. In some areas in the Antarctic, the Bootstrap technique shows ice concentrations higher than those of the Team algorithm by as much as 25{\%}; whereas, in other areas, it shows ice concentrations lower by as much as 30{\%}. The differences in the results are caused by temperature effects, emissivity effects, and tie point differences. The Team and the Bootstrap results were compared with available Landsat, advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. AVHRR, Landsat, and SAR data sets all yield higher concentrations than the passive microwave algorithms. Inconsistencies among results suggest the need for further validation studies.},

abstract = {AbstractThroughout much of the latter half of the twentieth century, the dominant mode of Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropical wintertime circulation variability—the Arctic Oscillation (AO)—exhibited a positive trend, with decreasing high-latitude sea level pressure (SLP) and increasing midlatitude SLP. General circulation models (GCMs) show that this trend is related to several factors, including North Atlantic SSTs, greenhouse gas/ozone-induced stratospheric cooling, and warming of the Indo-Pacific warm pool. Over the last approximately two decades, however, the AO has been decreasing, with 2009/10 featuring the most negative AO since 1900. Observational and idealized modeling studies suggest that snow cover, particularly over Eurasia, may be important. An observed snow–AO mechanism also exists, involving the vertical propagation of a Rossby wave train into the stratosphere, which induces a negative AO response that couples to the troposphere. Similar to other GCMs, the authors show that transient sim...},

The $\delta$18O of speleothem calcite at this Puerto Rican location varies primarily in response to changes in the amount of summer-time precipitation. The speleothem documents multi-decadal to centennial length oscillations in $\delta$18O that point to large variations in rainfall that have not been manifest in the short instrumental period. Since AD 1850, variations in $\delta$18O have tracked shifts in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).

abstract = {Decadal Sahelian rainfall variability was mainly
driven by sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during the
twentieth century. At the same time SSTs showed a
marked long-term global warming (GW)
trend. Superimposed on this long-term trend decadal
and multi-decadal variability patterns are observed
like the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and
the inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). Using
an atmospheric general circulation model we
investigate the relative contribution of each
component to the Sahelian precipitation
variability. To take into account the uncertainty
related to the use of different SST data sets, we
perform the experiments using HadISST1 and ERSSTv3
reconstructed sets. The simulations show that all
three SST signals have a significant impact over
West Africa: the positive phases of the GW and the
IPO lead to drought over the Sahel, while a positive
AMO enhances Sahel rainfall. The tropical SST
warming is the main cause for the GW impact on Sahel
rainfall. Regarding the AMO, the pattern of
anomalous precipitation is established by the SSTs
in the Atlantic and Mediterranean basins. In turn,
the tropical SST anomalies control the impact of the
IPO component on West Africa. Our results suggest
that the low-frequency evolution of Sahel rainfall
can be interpreted as the competition of three
factors: the effect of the GW, the AMO and the
IPO. Following this interpretation, our results show
that 50{\%} of the SST-driven Sahel drought in the
1980s is explained by the change to a negative phase
of the AMO, and that the GW contribution was
10{\%}. In addition, the partial recovery of Sahel
rainfall in recent years was mainly driven by the

abstract = {No current tree ring (TR) based reconstruction of
extratropical Northern Hemisphere (ENH) temperatures
that extends into the 1990s captures the full range
of late 20th century warming observed in the
instrumental record. Over recent decades, a
divergence between cooler reconstructed and warmer
instrumental large-scale temperatures is
observed. We hypothesize that this problem is partly
related to the fact that some of the constituent
chronologies used for previous reconstructions show
divergence against local temperatures in the recent
period. In this study, we compiled TR data and
published local/regional reconstructions that show
no divergence against local temperatures. These data
have not been included in other large-scale
temperature reconstructions. Utilizing this data
set, we developed a new, completely independent
reconstruction of ENH annual temperatures
(1750-2000). This record is not meant to replace
existing reconstructions but allows some degree of
independent validation of these earlier studies as
well as demonstrating that TR data can better model
recent warming at large scales when careful
selection of constituent chronologies is made at the
local scale. Although the new series tracks the
increase in ENH annual temperatures over the last
few decades better than any existing reconstruction,
it still slightly under predicts values in the
post-1988 period. We finally discuss possible
reasons why it is so difficult to model
post-mid-1980s warming, provide some possible
alternative approaches with regards to the
instrumental target and detail several
recommendations that should be followed in future
large-scale reconstruction attempts that may result
in more robust temperature estimates.},

@article{dool03,
abstract = {We have conducted an experiment to assess the real
time skill in monthly and seasonal predictions based
solely on patterns of antecedent hydrological
information over the United States. The hydrological
information is contained in a proxy for soil
moisture at 102 locations over the lower 48
states. This soil moisture is calculated over the
years 1931 to present from a local hydrological
equation taking monthly precipitation (P) and
temperature (T) as input, and producing soil
moisture (w), evaporation (E), runoff (R), and loss
to groundwater (G) as output. The initial condition
(IC) for the forecast procedure is soil moisture
over the United States at the end of the month
(w30). We constructed an analogue to the w30 fields,
i.e., made linear combinations of soil moisture
fields at the same time of year in years past to
reproduce the IC to within a small tolerance. The
coefficients assigned to the years past are then
made to persist, and the subsequent development in
the historical years is linearly combined to form a
forecast. This method has been running at CPC in
real time since 1998, and we added 1981-1997 in
"retroactive real time" mode to form a large enough
sample. In total, we considered both seasonal and
monthly forecasts at leads of -1 to +6 months for
1981-2001, for the elements w30, E, T, and P. From
the outset, we wanted to investigate nonlocal
forecast methods, considering local effects, on
evaporation and temperature mainly, as being
established already and well documented [Huang et
al., 1996]. In a nonlocal method we entertain the
possibility of precipitation (the response) falling
downstream of a soil moisture anomaly (forcing). We
found that we have about a 0.6 correlation in
forecasting monthly soil moisture with a lead of one
month (i.e., July at the end of May). This figure is
higher in spring and somewhat lower in the early
fall. The capability to forecast evaporation
anomalies is very seasonal. During the cold half of
the year, when E anomalies resemble T anomalies, the
correlation is only 0.2-0.3, but in summer, when E
anomalies resemble w anomalies, the skill of
forecasts goes up to 0.6. We thus have some insight
into patterns of anomalous water vapor input from
the land surface into the lower atmosphere on a
continental scale. Skill of forecasting T is modest,
reaching 0.2-0.3 in many months and seasons, but
there is no clear seasonal dependence that relates
to the presumed physics of land atmosphere
interactions. Skill in forecasting P is quite low,
barely 0.1 in correlation, but +ve in all months and
seasons. We did alternative experiments where the
constructed analogue was built on E, T, or P instead
of w and verified the forecast of all elements
likewise. We found initial w to be the best for
forecasting w itself and indeed for forecasting the
other fields as well! This is important testimony
that soil moisture is indeed the key, as has been
suspected by many for ages.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a bias problem in the estimate
of wavelet power spectra for atmospheric and oceanic

with the same amplitude at different frequencies the
conventionally adopted wavelet method does not
produce a spectrum with identical peaks, in contrast
to a Fourier analysis. The wavelet power spectrum in
this definition, that is, the transform coefficient
squared (to within a constant factor), is equivalent
to the integration of energy (in physical space)
over the influence period (time scale) the series
spans. Thus, a physically consistent definition of
energy for the wavelet power spectrum should be the
transform coefficient squared divided by the scale
it associates. Such adjusted wavelet power spectrum
results in a substantial improvement in the spectral
estimate, allowing for a comparison of the spectral
peaks across scales. The improvement is validated
with an artificial time series and a real coastal
sea level record. Also examined is the previous
example of the wavelet analysis of the Nino-3 SST

@article{sheppard02,
abstract = {This paper summarizes the current state of knowledge
of the climate of southwest USA (the 'Southwest'),
Low annual precipitation, clear skies, and
year-round warm climate over much of the Southwest
are due in large part to a quasi-permanent
subtropical high-pressure ridge over the
region. However, the Southwest is located between
the mid-latitude and subtropical atmospheric
circulation regimes, and this positioning relative
to shifts in these regimes is the fundamental reason
for the region's climatic variability. Furthermore,
the Southwest's complex topography and its
geographical proximity to the Pacific Ocean, the
Gulf of California, and the Gulf of Mexico also
contribute to this region's high climatic
variability, El Nino, which is an increase in
sea-surface temperature of the eastern equatorial
Pacific Ocean with an associated shift of the active
center of atmospheric convection from the western to
the central equatorial Pacific, has a well-developed
teleconnection with the Southwest, usually resulting
in wet winters. La Nina, the opposite oceanic case
of El Nino usually results in dry winters for the
Southwest. Another important oceanic influence on
winter climate of the Southwest is a feature called
the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which has
been defined as temporal variation in sea-surface
temperatures for most of the Northern Pacific Ocean,
The effects of ENSO and PDO can amplify each other,
resulting in increased annual variability in
precipitation over the Southwest. The major feature
that sets the climate of the Southwest apart from
the rest of the United States is the North American
monsoon, which in the US is most noticeable in
Arizona and New Mexico, Up to 50{\%} of the annual
rainfall of Arizona and New Mexico occurs as
monsoonal storms from July through
September. Instrumental measurement of temperature
and precipitation in the Southwest dates back to the
middle to late 1800s, From that record, average
annual rainfall of Arizona is 322 mm (12.7"), while
that of New Mexico is 340 nun (13.4"), and mean
annual temperature of New Mexico is cooler
(12degreesC [53degreesF]) than Arizona (17degreesC
[62degreesF]). As instrumental meteorological
records extend back only about 100 to 120 yr
throughout the Southwest, they are of limited
utility for studying climate phenomena of long time
frames. Hence, there is a need to extend the
measured meteorological record further back in time
using so-called 'natural archive' pal eo climate
records. Tree-ring data, which provide annual
resolution, range throughout the Southwest, extend
back in time for up to 1000 yr or more in various
forests of the Southwest, and integrate well the
influences of both temperature and precipitation,
are useful for this assessment of climate of the
Southwest. Tree growth of mid-elevation forests
typically responds to moisture availability during
the growing season, and a commonly used climate
variable in paleo-precipitation studies is the
Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which is a
single variable derived from variation in
precipitation and temperature. June-August PDSI
strongly represents precipitation and, to a lesser
extent, temperature of the year prior to the growing
season (prior September through current August), The
maximum intra-ring density of higher elevation trees
can yield a useful record of summer temperature
variation. The combined paleo-modern climate record
has at least 3 occurrences of multi-decadal
variation (50 to 80 yr) of alternating dry (below
average PDSI) to wet (above average PDSI). The
amplitude of this variation has increased since the
1700s. The most obvious feature of Because this
warming trend is outside the variation of the
natural archives, it is possible that anthropogenic
impacts, such as increased atmospheric
concentrations of greenhouse trace gases, are
playing a role in climate of the Southwest,
Accordingly, this pattern merits further research in
search of its cause or combination of causes.},

abstract = {A defining feature of Pacific decadal ENSO-like
variability is the similarity between its spatial
expression in sea surface temperature (SST) and the
spatial structure of interannual ENSO
variability. This similarity may indicate that the
decadal variability is merely a long-term average
over interannual ENSO variability. In contrast,
subtle differences (namely the meridionally
broadened tropical SST signature and emphasized
midlatitude SST anomalies for the decadal ENSO-like
pattern) may indicate that fundamentally different
processes are responsible for generating variability
on the decadal to interdecadal time scale. The
present study attempts to reconcile the subtly
different spatial structures of interannual ENSO and
decadal ENSO-like variability by relating the
decadal pattern to various SST patterns associated
with the development of the interannual ENSO
cycle. First, a statistical analysis is used to
reconstruct the decadal ENSO-like SST pattern as a
linear combination of interannual SST patterns. It
is shown that the decadal ENSO-like pattern is well
reconstructed in the absence of decadal spatial
information. Next, these interannual patterns are
physically interpreted in relation to the
interannual ENSO cycle. The analysis reveals that
the decadal ENSO-like SST pattern is obtained by
averaging over three SST patterns associated with
ENSO precursors, the peak of an ENSO event, and ENSO
"leftovers." The study provides a plausible
physical explanation for the spatial structure of
ENSO-like decadal variability as an average over
variations in the interannual ENSO cycle. The
results indicate that the prominent spatial features
of decadal ENSO-like variability are generated by
physical mechanisms that operate through the
interannual ENSO cycle. This does not imply,
however, that decadal processes are unimportant in
altering the decadal properties of ENSO. Results may
provide a framework for interpreting modeled decadal
ENSO-like variability and for constraining plausible
mechanisms of tropical decadal variability.},

abstract = {Precipitation in most of the Amazon shows
multi-decadal fluctuations that were linked to
oceanic forcing in the Atlantic. This modeling study
shows that vegetation dynamics may play a major role
in such low-frequency variability in the
Amazon. Despite the large amount of annual
precipitation, the presence of a dry season (albeit
short) facilitates a strong impact of dynamic
vegetation on precipitation persistence in the
model. The year-to-year variation of net primary
productivity (NPP) is dominated by that of the dry
season NPP. As a result, above-normal (below-normal)
precipitation in a particular year can enhance
(suppress) vegetation growth, leading to widespread
increase (decrease) of vegetation density in the
subsequent year. Precipitation in the subsequent
year is therefore more likely to be above (below)
normal. This damping effect of vegetation enhances
low-frequency variability of precipitation and leads
to recurrent droughts or floods, a result previously
considered characteristic of arid and semi-arid

All 24 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 models agree on these changes and, over the twenty-first century, average a phase delay of 5 days and an amplitude decrease of 5{\%} for the global mean ocean surface temperature. Evidence is provided that the changes are mainly driven by sea ice loss: as sea ice melts during the twenty-first century, the previously unexposed open ocean increases the effective heat capacity of the surface layer, slowing and damping the temperature response.

abstract = {This paper is devoted to illustrating new wavelet
analysis methods in the field of hydrology. New
wavelet indicators are applied to long-term
hydrological and climatologic proxies. They are
first applied to four Atlantic large river monthly
discharges (Amazon, Parana, Orinoco and Congo) and
then applied to two well-known long-term
climatologic indexes: the Southern Oscillation and
the North Atlantic Oscillation. This approach makes
it possible to suggest physical explanations for
time-scale dependant relationships. Six-month
variability is present in all the rivers except in
the Parana. In the Congo River this signal is near
stationary with strong entropy. The strength of this
scale coincides with higher discharge variability
before 1920 and over the Orinoco basin with higher
discharge values between 1940 and 1955. An annual
cycle is present in all the rivers but is much
stronger, along with the entropy, in the rivers with
a large tropical basin, as in the Amazon and the
Orinoco. This annual signal is not permanent in the
Congo and much more intermittent in the Parana where
the annual recharge appears as very irregular. A
quasi biennial variability is apparent in all the
equator ward rivers and a nearly permanent 2-year
coherence is found between Sol and the Amazon
discharge. A 3-6year oscillation typical of ENSO
variability is observed in all the rivers. It is
intermittent, observed before 1930 in all the rivers
and after 1980 mostly in the Amazon River. These
peaks of activity correspond to periods of major Sol
variability. An 8-year variability is particularly
strong in the Parana River before 1940 and around
1970 and to a lesser extent in the Orinoco River
during the low NAO index period, between 1940 and
1970. The Congo River exhibits that time-scale
around 1970. A 13-year variability common to Sol,
NAO and the South Atlantic Ocean circulation is
observed in the Parana and Congo discharges. In all
the rivers the greatest entropy is observed at bi
and multi decadal time scales with the greatest
coherence with both NAO and Sol. A near 20-year
time-scale is observed in most of the series around
1970, although it is strongest in Amazon and Parana
discharges. Finally, a 30-year time-scale is
observed between 1940 and 1970. It is to be noted
that most of the time-scale dominant activities, in
all the rivers, may have been influenced by the
interdecadal shifts that took place around 1940 and
1970 in the Pacific and in the Atlantic.},

The interface represents a sloping inversion layer coupling the two layers. The shape of the interface can be approximated by a cubic polynomial, and the interfacial coupling condition yields a set of algebraic equations that quantify the scale and intensity of the dammed flow as functions of the external parameters characterizing the environmental conditions. It is found that the cold dome shrinks as the Froude number increases or, to a minor degree, as the Ekman number decreases or/and the upstream inflow veers from northeasterly to southeasterly (with respect to a longitudinal mountain to the west). The mountain-parallel jet speed increases as the Ekman number decreases or/and th...},

Their difference isolates the impact of future Arctic sea ice loss upon the atmosphere. The tropospheric circulation response to the imposed ice loss resembles the negative phase of the northern annular mode, with the largest amplitude in winter, while the less well-known stratospheric response transitions from a slight weakening of the polar vortex in winter to a strengthening of the vortex in spring. The lack of a significant winter stratospheric circulation response is shown to be a consequence of largely cancelling effects from sea ice loss in the Atlantic and Pacific s...},

Our results extend previous conclusions that recent Northern Hemisphere surface temperature increases are likely anomalous in a long-term context. Recent warmth appears anomalous for at least the past 1,300 years whether or not tree-ring data are used. If tree-ring data are used, the conclusion can be extended to at least the past 1,700 years, but with additional strong caveats. The reconstructed amplitude of change over past centuries is greater than hitherto reported, with somewhat greater Medieval warmth in the Northern Hemisphere, albeit still not reaching recent levels.},

climate. Analysis of systematic space-based

relationship to surface conditions. The
characteristics of the annual cycle of tropical

tropical precipitation variability on time/space
scales ranging from synoptic cloud clusters through
the intraseasonal Madden-Julian Oscillation to
multiyear El Nino-Southern Oscillation cycle is
discussed. Links between tropical convection and
extratropical precipitation on time scales ranging
from synoptic to multiyear are examined, with
emphasis on conditions over the North Pacific-North
American sector during winter. Precipitation
variability over a number of regions bordering the
Atlantic basin are related to Atlantic sector modes
of SST and circulation variability. Systematic modes
of Atlantic variability and their relationship to
regional precipitation variability are described
with emphasis on the tropics. Changes in landscape
characteristics (vegetative cover, soil moisture,
surface roughness), whether natural or human
induced, result in changes in the surface radiation
balance and the fluxes of heat and moisture. Our
current understanding of the role of land surface
processes in sustaining or intensifying anomalous
precipitation regimes is briefly
discussed. Identification of an anthropogenic trend
in the presence of decadal-scale natural variations
in precipitation is a formidable challenge. Three
examples of large-amplitude secular variations in
regional precipitation regimes (Sahel, North
American Great Plains, and India) are discussed in
terms of possible forcing mechanisms. Continuous
global monitoring of precipitation is a challenging
task. Satellite-based observations, in conjunction
with effective use of surface-based ''ground truth''
data and further development of four-dimensional

realistic prospects for significant improvement in

abstract = {Prior to the 20th century Northern Hemisphere
average surface air temperatures have varied in the
order of 0.5 degrees C back to AD 1000. Various
climate reconstructions indicate that slow cooling
took place until the beginning of the 20th
century. Subsequently, global-average surface air
temperature increased by about 0.6 degrees C with
the 1990s being the warmest decade on record. The
pattern of warming has been greatest over
mid-latitude northern continents in the latter part
of the century. At the same time the frequency of
air frosts has decreased over many land areas, and
there has been a drying in the tropics and
sub-tropics. The late 20th century changes have been
attributed to global warming because of increases in
atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations due to
human activities. Underneath these trends is that of
decadal scale variability in the Pacific basin at
least induced by the Interdecadal Pacific
Oscillation (IPO), which causes decadal changes in
climate averages. On interannnual timescales El Ni
(n) over tildeo/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) causes
much variability throughout many tropical and
subtropical regions and some mid-latitude areas. The
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) provides climate
perturbations over Europe and northern
Africa. During the course of the 21st century
global-average surface temperatures are very likely
to increase by 2 to 4.5 degrees C as greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere increase. At the
same time there will be changes in precipitation,
and climate extremes such as hot days, heavy
rainfall and drought are expected to increase in
many areas. The combination of global warming,
superimposed on decadal climate variability (IPO)
and interannual fluctuations (ENSO, NAO) are
expected lead to a century of increasing climate
variability and change that will be unprecedented in
the history of human settlement. Although the

abstract = {Statistical analyses of long-term instrumental and
proxy data emphasize a distinction between two
quasi-decadal modes of climate variability. One mode
is linked to atmosphere-ocean interactions ('the
internal mode') and the other one is associated with
the solar sunspots cycle ('the solar mode'). The
distinct signatures of these two modes are also
detected in a high-resolution sediment core located
in the Cariaco basin. In the oceanic surface
temperature the internal mode explains about three
times more variance than the solar mode. In
contrast, the solar mode dominates over the internal
mode in the sea-level pressure and upper atmospheric
fields. The heterogeneous methods and data sets used
in this study underline the distinction between
these decadal modes and enable estimation of their
relative importance. The distinction between these

already over-allocated water supplies in the western
United States, prompting some water managers to seek
out and utilize new forms of climate data in their
planning efforts. One source of information that is
now being considered by water resource management is
extended hydrologic records from tree-ring
data. Scientists with the Western Water Assessment

streamflow (i.e., paleoclimate data) to water
managers in Colorado and other western states

technical workshops explaining the applications of
tree-ring data for water management for the past
eight years. Little is known, however, about what
has resulted from these engagements between
scientists and water managers. Using in-depth
interviews and a survey questionnaire, we attempt to
address this lack of information by examining the
outcomes of the interactions between WWA scientists
and western water managers to better understand how
paleoclimate data has been translated to water
resource management. This assessment includes an
analysis of what prompts water managers to seek out
tree-ring data, how paleoclimate data are utilized
by water managers in both quantitative and
qualitative ways, and how tree-ring data are
interpreted in the context of organization mandates
and histories. We situate this study within a
framework that examines the coproduction of science
and policy, where scientists and resource managers
collectively define and examine research and
planning needs, the activities of which are embedded
within wider social and political contexts. These
findings have broader applications for understanding
science-policy interactions related to climate and
climate change in resource management, and point to
the potential benefits of reflexive interactions of

abstract = {The potential role of solar variations in modulating
recent climate has been debated for many decades and
recent papers suggest that solar forcing may be less
than previously believed. Because solar variability
before the satellite period must be scaled from
proxy data, large uncertainty exists about phase and
magnitude of the forcing. We used a coupled climate
system model to determine whether proxy-based
irradiance series are capable of inducing climatic
variations that resemble variations found in climate
reconstructions, and if part of the previously
estimated large range of past solar irradiance
changes could be excluded. Transient simulations,
covering the published range of solar irradiance
estimates, were integrated from 850 AD to the
present. Solar forcing as well as volcanic and
anthropogenic forcing are detectable in the model
results despite internal variability. The resulting
climates are generally consistent with temperature
reconstructions. Smaller, rather than larger,
long-term trends in solar irradiance appear more
plausible and produced modeled climates in better
agreement with the range of Northern Hemisphere
temperature proxy records both with respect to phase
and magnitude. Despite the direct response of the
model to solar forcing, even large solar irradiance
change combined with realistic volcanic forcing over
past centuries could not explain the late 20th
century warming without inclusion of greenhouse gas
forcing. Although solar and volcanic effects appear
to dominate most of the slow climate variations
within the past thousand years, the impacts of
greenhouse gases have dominated since the second
half of the last century.},

connected to but not synonymous with El Nino, are
unprecedented in the climate record of the past 113

ENSO, where the two are strongly linked, that
emerges clearly on decadal time scales. In the
traditional El Nino region, sea surface temperature
anomalies (SSTAs) have waxed and waned, while SSTAs
in the central equatorial Pacific, which are better
linked to the SO, remained positive from 1990 to
June 1995. We carry out several statistical tests to
assess the likelihood that the recent behavior of
the SO is part of a natural decadal-timescale
variation. One test fits an autoregressive-moving
average (ARMA) model to a measure of the SO given by
the first hundred years of the pressures at Darwin,
Australia, beginning in 1882. Both the recent trend
for more ENSO events since 1976 and,the prolonged

abstract = {[1] The origins of the delayed increases in global
surface temperature accompanying El Nino events and
the implications for the role of diabatic processes
in El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are
explored. The evolution of global mean surface
temperatures, zonal means and fields of sea surface
temperatures, land surface temperatures,
precipitation, outgoing longwave radiation,
vertically integrated diabatic heating and
divergence of atmospheric energy transports, and
ocean heat content in the Pacific is documented
using correlation and regression analysis. For
1950-1998, ENSO linearly accounts for 0.06degreesC
of global surface temperature increase. Warming
events peak 3 months after SSTs in the Nino 3.4
region, somewhat less than is found in previous
studies. Warming at the surface progressively
extends to about +/-30 latitude with lags of several
months. While the development of ocean heat content
anomalies resembles that of the delayed oscillator
paradigm, the damping of anomalies through heat
fluxes into the atmosphere introduces a substantial
diabatic component to the discharge and recharge of
the ocean heat content. However, most of the delayed
warming outside of the tropical Pacific comes from
persistent changes in atmospheric circulation forced
from the tropical Pacific. A major part of the ocean
heat loss to the atmosphere is through evaporation
and thus is realized in the atmosphere as latent
heating in precipitation, which drives
teleconnections. Reduced precipitation and increased
solar radiation in Australia, Southeast Asia, parts
of Africa, and northern South America contribute to
surface warming that peaks several months after the
El Nino event. Teleconnections contribute to the
extensive warming over Alaska and western Canada
through a deeper Aleutian low and stronger southerly
flow into these regions 0-12 months later. The
1976/1977 climate shift and the effects of two major
volcanic eruptions in the past 2 decades are
reflected in different evolution of ENSO events. At
the surface, for 1979-1998 the warming in the
central equatorial Pacific develops from the west
and progresses eastward, while for 1950-1978 the
anomalous warming begins along the coast of South
America and spreads westward. The eastern Pacific
south of the equator warms 4-8 months later for
1979-1998 but cools from 1950 to 1978.},

abstract = {We present a new technique for isolating climate
signals in time series with a characteristic 'red'
noise background which arises from temporal
persistence. This background is estimated by a
'robust' procedure that, unlike conventional
techniques, is largely unbiased by the presence of
signals immersed in the noise. Making use of
multiple-taper spectral analysis methods, the
technique further provides for a distinction between
purely harmonic (periodic) signals, and broader-band
('quasiperiodic') signals. The effectiveness of our
signal detection procedure is demonstrated with
synthetic examples that simulate a variety of
possible periodic and quasiperiodic signals immersed
in red noise. We apply our methodology to historical
climate and paleoclimate time series
examples. Analysis of a approximate to 3 million
year sediment core reveals significant periodic
components at known astronomical forcing
periodicities and a significant quasiperiodic 100
year peak. Analysis of a roughly 1500 year tree-ring
reconstruction of Scandinavian summer temperatures
suggests significant quasiperiodic signals on a
near-century timescale, an interdecadal 16-18 year
timescale, within the interannual El Ninio/Southem
Oscillation (ENSO) band, and on a quasibiennial
timescale. Analysis of the 144 year record of Great
Salt Lake monthly volume change reveals a
significant broad band of significant interdecadal
variability, ENSO-timescale peaks, an annual cycle
and its harmonics. Focusing in detail on the
historical estimated global-average surface
temperature record, we find a highly significant
secular trend relative to the estimated red noise
background, and weakly significant quasiperiodic
signals within the ENSO band. Decadal and
quasibiennial signals are marginally significant in
this series.},

Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) for
1958 to 2001, adjusted for bias over the southern
oceans prior to 1.979, an analysis is made of global
patterns of monthly mean anomalies of atmospheric
mass, which is approximately conserved globally. It
differs from previous analyses of atmospheric
circulation by effectively area weighting surface or
sea level pressure that diminishes the role of high
latitudes. To examine whether global patterns of
behavior exist requires analysis of all seasons
together (as opposite seasons occur in each
hemisphere). Empirical orthogonal function (EOF)
analysis, R-mode varimax-rotated EOF analysis, and
cyclostationary EOF (CSEOF) analysis tools are used
to explore patterns and variability on interannual
and longer time scales. Clarification is given of
varimax terminology and procedures that have been
previously misinterpreted. The dominant global
monthly variability overall is associated with the
Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM), which is
active in all months of the year. However, it is not
very coherent from month to month and exhibits a
great deal of natural unforced variability. The
third most important pattern is the Northern
Hemisphere annular mode (NAM) and associated North
Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which is the equivalent
Northern Hemisphere expression. Neither of these is
really a global mode, although they covary on long
time scales in association with tropical or external
forcing. For monthly data, the second mode is
coherent with Nino-3.4 sea surface temperatures and
thus corresponds to El Nino-Southern Oscillation
(ENSO), which is truly global in extent. It exhibits
more coherent evolution with time and projects
strongest onto the interannual variability, where it
stands out by far as the dominant mode in the CSEOF
analysis. The CSEOF analysis extracts the patterns
phase locked with annual cycle and reveals their
evolution throughout the year. Standard EOF and
varimax analyses are not able to evolve with time of
year unless the analysis is stratified by
season. Varimax analysis is able to extract the SAM,
NAM, and ENSO modes very well, however.},

The tropical easterly trade winds are expected to weaken; surface ocean temperatures are expected to warm fastest near the equator and more slowly farther away; the equatorial thermocline that marks the transition between the wind-mixed upper ocean and deeper layers is expected to shoal; and the temperature gradients across the thermocline are expected to become steeper. Year-to-year ENSO variability is controlled by a delicate balance of amplifying and damping feedbacks, and one or more of the physical processes that are responsible for determining the characteristics of ENSO will probably be modified by climate change. Therefore, despite considerable progress in our understanding of the impact of climate change on many of the processes that contribute to El Ni{\~{n}}o variability, it is not yet possible to say whether ENSO activity will be enhanced or damped, or if the frequency of events will change.},

abstract = {To assess climate sensitivity from Earth radiation
observations of limited duration and observed sea
surface temperatures (SSTs) requires a closed and
therefore global domain, equilibrium between the
fields, and robust methods of dealing with
noise. Noise arises from natural variability in the
atmosphere and observational noise in precessing
satellite observations. This paper explores the
meaning of results that use only the tropical
region. We compute correlations and regressions
between tropical SSTs and top of-atmosphere (TOA)
longwave, shortwave and net radiation using a
variety of methods to test robustness of
results. The main changes in SSTs throughout the
tropics are associated with El Nino Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) events in which the dominant
changes in energy into an atmospheric column come
from ocean heat exchange through evaporation, latent
heat release in precipitation, and redistribution of
that heat through atmospheric winds. These changes
can be an order of magnitude larger than the net TOA
radiation changes, and their effects are
teleconnected globally, and especially into the
subtropics. Atmospheric model results are explored
and found to be consistent with observations. From
1985 to 1999 the largest perturbation in TOA
radiative fluxes was from the eruption of Mount
Pinatubo and clearly models which do not include
that forcing will not simulate the
effects. Consequently, regressions of radiation with
SSTs in the tropics may have nothing to say about
climate sensitivity. Citation: Trenberth, K. E.,

El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and global sea
surface temperatures (SSTs), and a measure of
continental U.S. summer drought during the twentieth
century. Potential nonlinearities and
nonstationarities in the relationships are
noted. During the first three decades of this
century, summer drought teleconnections in response
to SST patterns linked to ENSO are found to be
strongest in the southern regions of Texas, with
extensions into regions of the Midwest. From the
1930s through the 1950s, the drought teleconnection
pattern is found to extend into southern
Arizona. The most recent three decades show weak
teleconnections between summer drought over southern
Texas and Arizona, and winter SSTs, which is
consistent with previous findings. Instead, the
response to Pacific SSTs shows a clear shift to the
western United States and southern regions of
California. These epochal variations are consistent
with epochal variations observed in ENSO and other
low-frequency climate indicators. This changing
teleconnection response complicates statistical
forecasting of drought.},

abstract = {Flowering times are well-documented indicators of the ecological effects of climate change and are linked to numerous ecosystem processes and trophic interactions. Dozens of studies have shown that flowering times for many spring-flowering plants have become earlier as a result of recent climate change, but it is uncertain if flowering times will continue to advance as temperatures rise. Here, we used long-term flowering records initiated by Henry David Thoreau in 1852 and Aldo Leopold in 1935 to investigate this question. Our analyses demonstrate that record-breaking spring temperatures in 2010 and 2012 in Massachusetts, USA, and 2012 in Wisconsin, USA, resulted in the earliest flowering times in recorded history for dozens of spring-flowering plants of the eastern United States. These dramatic advances in spring flowering were successfully predicted by historical relationships between flowering and spring temperature spanning up to 161 years of ecological change. These results demonstrate that numerous temperate plant species have yet to show obvious signs of physiological constraints on phenological advancement in the face of climate change.},

abstract = {For the period 1987 to 1993, quantities central to
the global moisture budget from the global analyses
of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts (ECMWF), the U.S. National Meteorological
Center (NMC), and NASA/Goddard have been computed
and compared. The precipitable water is computed and
compared with satellite data from the Special Sensor
Microwave Imager (SSM/I). Fluxes of moisture and
their divergence have been used to estimate the
vertically integrated moisture budget and thus
evaporation minus precipitation (E - P) as
residuals. Results of several test computations show
that small biases exist in precipitable water as
vertical resolution and methods of computing
vertical integrals are changed, but the impact is
small on the moisture budget. In the Tropics and
subtropics the moisture budget is dominated by the
divergence field rather than the moisture amounts,
and consequently initialization of the analyses has
an impact on the perceived moisture budget. The
diurnal cycle is shown to be important especially
for E - P. For the vertically integrated moisture
budget, the use of pressure coordinates instead of
the model coordinates on which the data are analyzed
produces acceptably small differences for the most
part, although adequate resolution at low levels and
proper treatment of the surface is
important. Computations at different horizontal
resolutions reveal the importance of adequate
resolution in the vicinity of steep orography but
also that resolution is not a big factor on large
scales even where steep gradients in precipitation
exist. The implication is that it is the veracity bf
the large-scale divergence and moisture fields
themselves that contribute to problems, and these
arise from the moist physics of the assimilating
model used in four-dimensional data assimilation,
which dominates the character of the
analyses. However, in the subtropics large positive
biases are present in precipitable water in the
ECMWF and, to a lesser extent, NMC analyses and are
partly due to the assimilation of biased TOVS
retrievals. The effects of the large and spurious
changes in analysis systems at ECMWF and NMC are
manifested in the results. Differences between ECMWF
and NMC E - P locally are 60{\%}-75{\%} of the values
themselves in the Tropics at T31 resolution and
about one-half as much at T15 resolution, and they
are not diminishing with time. By making use of
estimates off and P from the NASA/Goddard
reanalysis, both spatial and temporal variability of
E - P are found to be dominated by the P
field. Accordingly, for part of 1987 and 1988,
estimates of precipitation from the Global
Precipitation Climatology Project are used to
qualitatively assess the E - P estimates. The ECMWF
estimates appear to be best at that time, but since
then the NMC values have become less intense while
the ECMWF estimates have greatly intensified. The
large differences that still exist in such estimates
are apt to be carried over to the NMC and ECMWF
reanalysis products.},

twentieth century Sahelian drought when only forced
by observed SST time evolution has been
characterized. Atmospheric internal variability is
shown to have a strong contribution in driving the
simulated precipitation variability over the Sahel
at decadal to multi-decadal time scales. The
simulated drought is associated with a southward
shift of the continental rainbelt over central and
eastern Sahel, associated with an inter-hemispheric
SST mode (the southern hemisphere oceans warming
faster than the northern ones after 1970). The
analysis of idealized experiments further highlights
the importance of the Pacific basin. The related
increase of the tropospheric temperature (TT) over
the tropics is then suggested to dry the margin of
convection zones over Africa, in agreement with the
so-called "upped-ante" mechanism. A simple metric is
then defined to determine the ability of the CMIP3
coupled models in reproducing both the observed
Sahel drying and these mechanisms, in order to
determine the reliability of the twenty-first
century scenarios. Only one model reproduces both
the observed drought over the Sahel and consistent
SST/TT relationships over the second half of the
twentieth century. This model predicts enhanced dry
conditions over the Sahel at the end of the
twenty-first century. However, as the mechanisms
highlighted here for the recent period are not
stationary during the twenty-first century when
considering the trends, similarities between
observed and simulated features of the West African
monsoon for the twentieth century are a necessary
but insufficient condition for a trustworthy

prediction schemes has been developed during the
Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program
which includes statistical schemes and physical
models.The statistical models are, in general, based
on linear statistical techniques and can be
classified into models which use atmospheric (sea
level pressure or surface wind) or oceanic (sea
surface temperature or a measure of upper ocean heat
content) quantities or a combination of oceanic and
atmospheric quantities as predictors. The physical
models consist of coupled ocean-atmosphere models of
varying degrees of complexity, ranging from
simplified coupled models of the "shallow water"
type to coupled general circulation models. All
models, statistical and physical, perform
considerably better than the persistence forecast in
predicting typical indices of ENSO on lead times of
6 to 12 months. The TOGA program can be regarded as
a success from this perspective. However, despite
the demonstrated predictability, little is known
about ENSO predictability limits and the
predictability of phenomena outside the tropical
Pacific. Furthermore, the predictability of
anomalous features known to be associated with ENSO
(e.g., Indian monsoon and Sahel rainfall, southern
African drought, and off-equatorial sea surface
temperature) needs to be addressed in more
detail. As well, the relative importance of
different physical mechanisms (in the ocean or
atmosphere) has yet to be established. A seasonal
dependence in predictability is seen in many models,
but the processes responsible for it are not fully
understood, and its meaning is still a matter of
scientific discussion. Likewise, a marked decadal
variation in skill is observed, and the reasons for
this are still under investigation. Finally, the
different prediction models yield similar skills,
although they are initialized quite differently. The
reasons for these differences are also unclear.},

Although it is possible to calculate Arctic sea ice thickness using measurements acquired by CryoSat-2, the latency of the final release data set is typically 1 month due to the time required to determine precise satellite orbits. We use a new fast-delivery CryoSat-2 data set based on preliminary orbits to compute Arctic sea ice thickness in near real time (NRT), and analyse this data for one sea ice growth season from October 2014 to April 2015. We show that this NRT sea-ice-thickness product is of comparable accuracy to that produced using the final release CryoSat-2 data, with a mean thickness difference of 0.9 cm, demonstrating that the satellite orbit is not a critical factor in determining sea ice freeboard. In addition, the CryoSat-2 fast-delivery product also provides measurements of Arctic sea ice thickness within 3 days of acquisition by the satellite, and a measurement is delivered, on average, within 14, 7 and 6 km of each location in the Arctic every 2, 14 and 28 days respectively. The CryoSat-2 NRT sea-ice-thickness data set provides an additional constraint for short-term and seasonal predictions of changes in the Arctic ice cover and could support industries such as tourism and transport through assimilation in operational models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We present our estimates of the thickness and volume of the Arctic Ocean ice cover from CryoSat-2 data acquired between October 2010 and May 2014. Average ice thickness and draft differences are within 0.16 m of measurements from other sources (moorings, submarine, electromagnetic sensors, IceBridge). The choice of parameters that affect the conversion of ice freeboard to thickness is discussed. Estimates between 2011 and 2013 suggest moderate decreases in volume followed by a notable increase of more than 2500 km(3) (or 0.34 m of thickness over the basin) in 2014, which could be attributed to not only a cooler summer in 2013 but also to large-scale ice convergence just west of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago due to wind-driven onshore drift. Variability of volume and thickness in the multiyear ice zone underscores the importance of dynamics in maintaining the thickness of the Arctic ice cover. Volume estimates are compared with those from ICESat as well as the trends in ice thickness derived from submarine ice draft between 1980 and 2004. The combined ICESat and CryoSat-2 record yields reduced trends in volume loss compared with the 5 year ICESat record, which was weighted by the record-setting ice extent after the summer of 2007.},

Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) Drought
Working Group initiative were analyzed to determine
the impact of three patterns of sea surface
temperature (SST) anomalies on drought and pluvial
frequency and intensity around the world. The three
SST forcing patterns include a global pattern
similar to the background warming trend, a pattern
in the Pacific, and a pattern in the Atlantic. Five
different global atmospheric models were forced by
fixed SSTs to test the impact of these SST anomalies
on droughts and pluvials relative to a
climatologically forced control run. The five
models generally yield similar results in the
locations of drought and pluvial frequency changes
throughout the annual cycle in response to each
given SST pattern. In all of the simulations, areas
with an increase in the mean drought (pluvial)
conditions tend to also show an increase in the
frequency of drought (pluvial) events.
Additionally, areas with more frequent extreme
events also tend to show higher intensity
extremes. The cold Pacific anomaly increases drought
occurrence in the United States and southern South
America and increases pluvials in Central America
and northern and central South America. The cold
Atlantic anomaly increases drought occurrence in
southern Central America, northern South America,
and central Africa and increases pluvials in central
South America. The warm Pacific and Atlantic
anomalies generally lead to reversals of the drought
and pluvial increases described with the
corresponding cold anomalies. More modest impacts
are seen in other parts of the world. The impact of
the trend pattern is generally more modest than that
of the two other anomaly patterns.},

abstract = {A detailed description is presented of the statistical patterns of climate forcing of tree growth (annual maximum latewood density and ring-width time series), across a network of 387 specially selected conifer sites that circle the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere. The in uence of summer temperature dominates growth. A mean April-September response is optimum for describing the major forcing signal over the whole densito-metric network, though a shorter June-July season is more relevant in central and eastern Siberia. The ring- width chronologies also have a shorter optimum (June-August) seasonal signal, but this is much weaker than the density signal. The association between tree-ring density and precipitation variability (as measured by partial correlations to account for the correlation between temperature and precipitation) is considerably weaker than with temperature. The ring-width response to precipitation is dominated by noise' and local site in uences, though a negative response to winter precipitation in northern Siberia is consistent with the suggestion of an in uence of delayed snowmelt. Average correlations with winter temperatures are small for all regions and correlations with annual temperatures are positive only because of the strong link with summer temperatures. Reconstructions of summer temperature based on composite regional density chronologies for nine areas are presented. Five regions (northwestern North America, NWNA; eastern and central Canada, ECCA; northern Europe, NEUR; northern Siberia, NSIB; and eastern Siberia, ESIB) constitute an arbitrary northern' division of the network, while the four other regions (western North America, WNA; southern Europe, SEUR; central Asia, CAS; and the Tibetan Plateau, TIBP) make up the southern' part. We also present two larger composite regional reconstructions comprising the data from the five higher-latitude (HILAT) and four lower-latitude (LOLAT) areas respectively; and a single series made up of data from all regions (ALL), which is highly correlated with Northern Hemisphere mean summer temperature. We calculate time-dependent uncertainty ranges for each of these reconstructions, though they are not intended to represent long timescales of tempera ture variability ({\textgreater}100 years) because the technique used to assemble the site chronologies precludes this. Finally, we examine in more detail the reduced sensitivity in the tree-growth data to decadal-timescale summer-temperature trends during the last 50 years, identified in earlier published work.},

abstract = {The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a
climate-forcing mechanism that has been shown to
affect precipitation and the occurrence of wildfires
in many parts of the world. In the southern United
States and northern Mexico, warm events (El Nino)
are associated with moist winter conditions and
fewer fires, while cool events (La Nina) tend to
favor dry winters and more fires. We tested this
relationship in a region of northeastern Mexico by
characterizing the historical fire regime and
climatic influences. Fire regimes were reconstructed
from fire-scar samples collected from 100 trees in
three high-elevation sites on Pena Nevada in
southern Nuevo Leon. The sites were similar to 25 ha
each, and the site centers were similar to 1 km
apart. The earliest recorded fire occurred in 1521
and the time period we used for analysis was
1645-1929. The sites were characterized by frequent
surface fires before the 1920s. In the three sites,
mean fire intervals ranged from 8.6 to 9.6 years
(all fires) and 11.9 to 18.6 years (fires that
scarred {\textgreater}= 25{\%} of recording trees). The per-tree
mean fire return interval was 17 years, and all
three sites burned in the same year seven times
between 1774 and 1929. After 1929, fires were nearly
eliminated in all sites, likely due to human
causes. We found a temporal change in the
association between ENSO events and fires; before
the 1830s La Nina events were significantly
associated with fire years, while after the 1830s
this association was not significant. In 1998, when
the most severe El Nino event of the past century
occurred, the three sites experienced severe,
stand-replacing fires that killed many trees that
had survived multiple surface fires in the
past. Prior to the 1830s, fires tended to occur
during dry La Nina years, but since then both La
Nina and El Nino have been associated with dry years
in this region, especially during the last three
decades. This result suggests that ENSO effects have
changed over time in this location and that phases
of ENSO are not consistent indicators of
precipitation, fire occurrence, or fire behavior in
this area of northeastern Mexico.},

the difference between pollen samples, and, thus,
represent the potential magnitude of climatic change
underlying the pollen record. The magnitude varied
significantly among time scales with small changes
common at centennial to millennial scales and large
changes common at multi-millennial (i.e. orbital)
scales. SCDs measured across 3000-yr intervals
averaged 0.20, and often exceeded the maximum
difference expected from samples collected within
the same biome (0.15). SCDs across individual
millennia were smaller and averaged 0.08. SCDs

large at sub-millennial scales, equal about 5-25{\%} of

abstract = {Rainfall variability over the Amazon basin has often
been linked to variations in Pacific sea surface
temperature (SST), and in particular, to the El
Nio/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, only a
fraction of Amazon rainfall variability can be
explained by ENSO. Building upon the recent work of
Zeng (Environ Res Lett 3:014002, 2008), here we
provide further evidence for an influence on Amazon
rainfall from the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The
strength of the North Atlantic influence is found to
be comparable to the better-known Pacific ENSO
connection. The tropical South Atlantic Ocean also
shows some influence during the wet-to-dry season
transition period. The Atlantic influence is through
changes in the north-south divergent circulation and
the movement of the ITCZ following warm
SST. Therefore, it is strongest in the southern part
of the Amazon basin during the Amazon's dry season
(July-October). In contrast, the ENSO related
teleconnection is through anomalous east-west Walker
circulation with largely concentrated in the eastern
(lower) Amazon. This ENSO connection is seasonally
locked to boreal winter. A complication due to the
influence of ENSO on Atlantic SST causes an apparent
North Atlantic SST lag of Amazon rainfall. Removing
ENSO from North Atlantic SST via linear regression
resolves this causality problem in that the residual
Atlantic variability correlates well and is in phase
with the Amazon rainfall. A strong Atlantic
influence during boreal summer and autumn is
particularly significant in terms of the impact on
the hydro-ecosystem which is most vulnerable during
the dry season, as highlighted by the severe 2005
Amazon drought. Such findings have implications for
both seasonal-interannual climate prediction and
understanding the longer-term changes of the Amazon
rainforest.},

These profound changes to the Arctic system have coincided with a period of ostensibly more frequent extreme weather events across the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, including severe winters. The possibility of a link between Arctic change and mid-latitude weather has spurred research activities that reveal three potential dynamical pathways linking Arctic amplification to mid-latitude weather: changes in storm tracks, the jet stream, and planetary waves and their associated energy propagation. Through changes in these key atmospheric features, it is possible, in principle, for sea ice and snow cover to jointly influence mid-latitude weather. However, because of incomplete knowledge of how high-latitude climate change influences these phenomena, combined with sparse and short data records, and imperfect models, large uncertainties regarding the magnitude of such an influence remain. We conclude that improved process understanding, sustained and additional Arctic observations, and better coordinated modelling studies will be needed to advance our understanding of the influences on mid-latitude weather and extreme events.},

The weekly product has been available since 1993 and is widely used for weather and climate monitoring and forecasting. Errors in the satellite bias correction and the sea ice to SST conversion algorithm are discussed, and then an improved version of the OI analysis is developed. The changes result in a modest reduction in the satellite bias that leaves small global residual biases of roughly −0.03°C. The major improvement in the analysis occurs at high latitudes due to the new sea ice algorithm where local differences between the old and new analysis can exceed 1°C. Comparisons with other SST products are needed to determine the consistency of the OI. These comparisons show that the differences among products occur on large time- and space scales wit...},

hydrological cycles from eight current atmospheric
reanalyses and their depiction of changes over

is on the mean ocean, land, and global precipitation
P; the corresponding evaporation E; their difference
corresponding to the surface freshwater flux E-P;
and the vertically integrated atmospheric moisture
transports. Using the model based P and E, the
time-and area-average E-P for the oceans, P-E for
land, and the moisture transport from ocean to land
should all be identical but are not close in most
reanalyses, and often differ significantly from
observational estimates of the surface return flow
based on net river discharge into the oceans. Their
differences reveal outstanding issues with
atmospheric models and their biases, which are
manifested as analysis increments in the
reanalyses. The NCAR CCSM4, along with most
reanalysis models, the exception being MERRA, has
too-intense water cycling (P and E) over the ocean
although ocean-to-land transports are very close to
observed. Precipitation from reanalyses that
assimilate moisture from satellite observations
exhibits large changes identified with the changes
in the observing system, as new and improved
temperature and water vapor channels are assimilated
and, while P improves after about 2002, E-P does
not. Discrepancies among hydrological cycle
components arise from analysis increments that can
add or subtract moisture. The large-scale moisture
budget divergences are more stable in time and
similar across reanalyses than model-based estimates
of E-P. Results are consistent with the view that
recycling of moisture is too large in most models
and the lifetime of moisture is too short. For the
energy cycle, most reanalyses have spurious
imbalances of similar to 10 W m(-2) within the
atmosphere, and similar to 5-10 W m(-2) in net
fluxes into the surface and to space. Major
improvements are needed in model treatment and
assimilation of moisture, and surface fluxes from

abstract = {Paleoclimate records from the tropical Pacific
suggest the early to mid-Holocene was a period of
reduced El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
variability, with a transition to modern, increased
ENSO frequency occurring some time in the last few
thousand years. However, the nature and timing of
this shift remains uncertain due to the
discontinuous nature and/or coarse resolution of
many ENSO proxies, as well as a lack of agreement
between previously published records. A new,
continuous, climate record from El Junco Crater Lake
in the Galdpagos Islands reveals several abrupt
changes in lake level and precipitation through the
Holocene. Hydroclimatic model simulations suggest
that El Junco lake level responds sensitively to
increases in precipitation associated with El Nino
events, rising during wet El Nino events and falling
during the intervening dry periods. Grain size data
from El Junco sediment cores indicate past lake
level variability, likely associated with changing
seasonal precipitation and ENSO frequency. The grain
size data suggest increased precipitation intensity
prior to 9000+/-120 cal years BP, and after
4200+/-130 cal years BR as well as a two-step
increase in precipitation at 3200+/-160 and
2000+/-100 cal years BP. Maximum Holocene
precipitation and inferred ENSO variability occurred
between 2000+/-100 and 1500+/-70 cal years BP,
during the same period that six other independent
proxy records suggest higher ENSO frequency and
longer, stronger El Nino events. Decreasing sediment
carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios in El Junco sediments
indicate rising lake levels from the early Holocene
to present, corroborating the grain size data. The
inferred increase in precipitation at 4200+/-130 cal
years BP and at 2000 +/- 100 cal years BP coincides
with decreasing Southwest Asian and East Asian
Monsoon intensity, suggesting tropical Pacific
climate and the Asian monsoon were interconnected
systems at centennial to millennial timescales
during the Holocene. A weakening trend in the Asian
monsoon and the trend toward wetter conditions at El
Junco also coincide with a trend toward cooler and
drier conditions inferred from Cariaco Basin
sediment proxies from the mid-Holocene to present,
suggesting the migration of the Intertropical
Convergence Zone (ITCZ) likely influenced
hydrological changes in both the eastern tropical
Pacific and the Asian Monsoon region during the

Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming.

While the effects of early springs across North America are widely documented, changes in their frequency and likelihood under the combined influences of climate change and natural variability are poorly understood. Extremely early springs, such as March 2012, can lead to severe economical losses and agricultural damage when these are followed by hard freeze events. Here we use the new Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble project and Extended Spring Indices to simulate historical and future spring onsets across the United States and in the particular the Great Lakes region. We found a marked increase in the frequency of March 2012-like springs by midcentury in addition to an overall trend towards earlier spring onsets, which nearly doubles that of observational records. However, changes in the date of last freeze do not occur at the same rate, therefore, causing a potential increase in the threat of plant tissue damage. Although large-scale climate modes, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, have previously dominated decadal to multidecadal spring onset trends, our results indicate a decreased role in natural climate variability and hence a greater forced response by the end of the century for modulating trends. Without a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, our study suggests that years like 2012 in the US could become normal by mid-century.},

abstract = {North Pacific climate variability is characterized by pronounced band-limited multi-decadal (e.g., 20-40 years) variability and apparent regime shifts in instrumental sea level pressure and sea surface temperature (SST) records. This variability is commonly expressed in index form as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The state of the PDO has strong impacts on local climate along the North Pacific Rim, as well as on climate downstream across large parts of North America. The PDO is based on SST records that only extend back to the mid-19th century at best, with the most commonly used version of the index beginning in 1900. Robustly characterizing multi-decadal variability in such short records is a serious statistical challenge. In addition, the observed behavior of the PDO may be significantly contaminated by the effects of greenhouse warming, especially during the latter half of the 20th century. This makes the description of the PDO as a long-term natural mode of North Pacific climate variability uncertain as well. Annually resolved and exactly dated tree-ring records from western North America and sensitive to north Pacific climate variability and change can be used to extend the short instrumental PDO back several centuries to a millennium now. Several such PDO reconstructions exist now, each with robustly expressed long-term, band-limited, multi-decadal variability similar to that found in the instrumental data, but they do not all agree in the pre-1900 period not used for calibration. This appears to be due to systematic low-frequency differences between PDO reconstructions depending on the geographic locations of the tree-ring chronologies used, principally those north and south of 40°N. These differences appear to come and go back in time at near-centennial time scales. This suggests that the spatial impact of the PDO on North American climate varies over time in ways not possible to discern from the instrumental data. It also suggests that care must be taken in selecting which published PDO reconstruction is used for further studies of North Pacific climate variability.},

It is estimated that the atmospheric lifetime of CH3Br that is due to reaction with OH is about 2 yr, which results in a calculated global emission rate of about 100 Gg/yr. Ocean supersaturations of 140-180 percent are observed, and atmospheric concentrations over the open oceans are higher than at comparably located coastal sites. The ocean source is estimated to be about 35 Gg/yr. The remaining emissions must come from other natural sources and anthropogenic activities.},

abstract = {The tropical Atlantic interhemispheric gradient in
sea surface temperature significantly influences the
rainfall climate of the tropical Atlantic sector,
including droughts over West Africa and Northeast
Brazil. This gradient exhibits a secular trend from
the beginning of the twentieth century until the
1980s, with stronger warming in the south relative
to the north. This trend behavior is on top of a
multidecadal variation associated with the Atlantic
multidecadal oscillation. A similar long-term forced
trend is found in a multimodel ensemble of forced
twentieth-century climate simulations. Through
examining the distribution of the trend slopes in
the multimodel twentieth-century and preindustrial
models, the authors conclude that the observed trend
in the gradient is unlikely to arise purely from
natural variations; this study suggests that at
least half the observed trend is a forced response
to twentieth-century climate forcings. Further
analysis using twentieth-century single-forcing runs
indicates that sulfate aerosol forcing is the
predominant cause of the multimodel trend. The
authors conclude that anthropogenic sulfate aerosol
emissions, originating predominantly from the
Northern Hemisphere, may have significantly altered
the tropical Atlantic rainfall climate over the
twentieth century.},

A highly uncertain area of scientific research, however, is whether such Arctic change has a tangible effect on weather and climate at lower latitudes. There is emerging evidence that the geographical location of sea ice loss is critically important in determining the large-scale atmospheric circulation response and associated midlatitude impacts. However, such regional dependencies have not been explored in a thorough and systematic manner. To make progress on this issue, this study analyzes ensemble simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model prescribed with sea ice loss separately in nine regions of the Arctic, to elucidate the distinct responses to regional sea ice loss. The results suggest that in some regions, sea ice loss triggers large-scale dynamical responses, whereas in other regions sea ice loss induces only local thermodynamical changes.

We find that the models' total zonally-integrated northward moisture flux agrees reasonably well with the reanalysis, but with large compensating regional biases. Specifically, the models systematically underpredict the moisture flux in the Atlantic sector and overpredict it in the Pacific sector. The biases are predominantly due to misrepresentation of extreme moisture flux events, which are know to exert a significant control on Arctic climate. Biases in these high-intensity fluxes are almost entirely contributed by biases in the meridional velocity, suggesting a link with biases in storm track activity at lower latitudes. We assess the extent to which the deficit of moisture intrusions in the Atlantic sector and excess in the Pacific sector may account for biases in the climate of the respective sectors.

a higher-frequency mode after 1750, with 15 - 20-yr
droughts becoming rare. Comparisons between

A coupled ice–ocean model is used to determine the state of the ice and ocean over the past 29 yr to investigate the causes of this ice extent minimum within a historical perspective. It is found that even though the 2007 ice extent was strongly anomalous, the loss in total ice mass was not. Rather, the 2007 ice mass loss is largely consistent with a steady decrease in ice thickness that began in 1987. Since then, the simulated mean September ice thickness within the Arctic Ocean has declined from 3.7 to 2.6 m at a rate of −0.57 m decade−1. Both the area coverage of thin ice at the beginning of the melt season and the total volume of ice lost in the summer have been steadily increasing. The combined impact of these two trends caused a large reduction in the September mean ice concentration in the Arctic Ocean.

abstract = {Here the 1976-77 climate regime shift that was
accompanied by a remarkable change in the lead-lag
relationships between Indian Ocean sea surface
temperature (SST) and El Ni (n) over tildeo
evolution is shown. After the 1976-77 regime shift,
a correlation analysis suggests that southern Indian
Ocean SSTs observed during late boreal winter are a
key precursor in predicting El Ni (n) over tildeo
evolution as the traditional oceanic heat content
anomalies in the equatorial Pacific or zonal wind
anomalies over the equatorial western Pacific. The
possible physical mechanisms underlying this highly
significant statistical relationship are
discussed. After the 1976-77 regime shift, southern
Indian Ocean SST anomalies produced by Mascarene
high pulses during boreal winter trigger coupled
air-sea processes in the tropical eastern Indian
Ocean during the following seasons. This produces a
persistent remote forcing on the Pacific climate
system, promoting wind anomalies over the western
equatorial Pacific and modulating the regional
Hadley cell in the southwest Pacific. These
modulations, in turn, excite Rossby waves, which
produce quasi-stationary circulation anomalies in
the extratropical South Pacific, responsible for the
development of the southern branch of the ''
horseshoe '' El Nino pattern. The change of the
background SST state that occurred in the late 1970s
over the Indian Ocean may also explain why ENSO
evolution is different before and after the 1976-77
regime shift. These results shed some light on the
possible influence of global warming or decadal
fluctuations on El Nino evolution through changes in
teleconnection patterns between the Indian and
Pacific Oceans.},

abstract = {Over the past 30 years, methyl bromide (MBr), a broad spectrum fumigant, has been used extensively for soilborne disease and pest control in the production of many fruit, vegetable, turf, and nursery crops. Recently, agricultural emissions of MBr were implicated as a potentially significant contributor to stratospheric ozone depletion. As a precautionary measure for global ozone protection, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has enforced federal legislation which mandates a complete phase-out of MBr use within the United States by 1 January 2001. Thus, new cost effective, environmentally compatible strategies for control of nematodes and other soilborne pests and pathogens must be developed and tested in a relatively short time to avoid significant losses in crop productivity. The extent to which certain agricultural industries that are now heavily reliant on MBr are affected will depend on the development of sustainable, integrated tactics to pest control, such as combinations of cultural, chemical, and biological tactics. New muhidisciplinary research and extension programs must be developed to address and overcome major constraints and incompatibilities that have prevented such tactics from being widely adopted.},

abstract = {The NCEP and NCAR are cooperating in a project
(denoted ''reanalysis'') to produce a 40-year record
of global analyses of atmospheric fields in support
of the needs of the research and climate monitoring
communities. This effort involves the recovery of
land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft,
satellite, and other data; quality controlling and
assimilating these data with a data assimilation
system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis
period 1957-96. This eliminates perceived climate
jumps associated with changes in the data
assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis
uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data
assimilation system and a database as complete as
possible. The data assimilation and the model used
are identical to the global system implemented
operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except
that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210
km). The database has been enhanced with many
sources of observations not available in real time
for operations, provided by different countries and
organizations. The system has been designed with
advanced quality control and monitoring components,
and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a
Gray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output
archives are being created to satisfy different user
needs, including a ''quick look'' CD-ROM (one per
year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields
available twice daily, as well as surface,
top-of-the atmosphere, and isentropic
fields. Reanalysis information and selected output
is also available on-line via the Internet
(http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CDROM,
containing 13 years of selected observed, daily,
monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR
Reanalysis, is included with this issue. Output
variables are classified into four classes,
depending on the degree to which they are influenced
by the observations and/or the model. For example,
''C'' variables (such as precipitation and surface
fluxes) are completely determined by the model
during the data assimilation and should be used with
caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these
variables with observations and with several
climatologies shows that they generally contain
considerable useful information. Eight-day
forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful
for predictability studies and for monitoring the
quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of
reanalysis (1957-96) should be completed in early
1997. A continuation into the future through an
identical Climate Data Assimilation System will
allow researchers to reliably compare recent
anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since
changes in the observing systems will inevitably
produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel
reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated
for the periods immediately after the introduction
of new observing systems, such as new types of
satellite data. NCEP plans currently call for an
updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system
every five years or so. The successive reanalyses
will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the
comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.},

little is known about decadal-to centennial-scale

analysis of diatom-inferred salinity from a site in
the Northern Great Plains to reconstruct
multidecadal-and centennial-scale climatic patterns
during the early Holocene. The diatom-inferred
salinity indicates a transition from fresh to highly
saline conditions between c. 13 400 and 7700 cal. yr
BP, which suggests a major shift in climate from wet
to dry conditions. The overall trend toward
increasing salinity is interrupted by several
freshwater intervals between c. 9800 and 7950
cal. yr BP, which may be the result of an increase
in the frequency of monsoonal flow from the Gulf of
Mexico. The early Holocene is considered to be a
time of rapid change in climate and vegetation
within the Holocene. Although rates of change in the
Moon Lake diatom assemblages were high during parts
of the early Holocene, in general the rate of change
was as great or greater during the last two
millennia. This finding may be the result of a
generally directional change in climate in the early
Holocene, in contrast to shorter-term fluctuations
and little directionality in the late Holocene.},

slightly during the 1980s. Together, the global land

abstract = {The Earth's climate is changing rapidly as a result of anthropogenic carbon emissions, and damaging impacts are expected to increase with warming. To prevent these and limit long-term global surface warming to, for example, 2 °C, a level of stabilization or of peak atmospheric CO2 concentrations needs to be set. Climate sensitivity, the global equilibrium surface warming after a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration, can help with the translation of atmospheric CO2 levels to warming. Various observations favour a climate sensitivity value of about 3 °C, with a likely range of about 2–4.5 °C. However, the physics of the response and uncertainties in forcing lead to fundamental difficulties in ruling out higher values. The quest to determine climate sensitivity has now been going on for decades, with disturbingly little progress in narrowing the large uncertainty range. However, in the process, fascinating new insights into the climate system and into policy aspects regarding mitigation have been gained. The well-constrained lower limit of climate sensitivity and the transient rate of warming already provide useful information for policy makers. But the upper limit of climate sensitivity will be more difficult to quantify.},

@article{trenberth02_heat_budget,
abstract = {[1] Interannual variability of the atmospheric heat
budget is explored via a new data set of the
computed vertically integrated energy transports to
examine relationships with other fields. A case
study reveals very large monthly divergences of
these transports regionally with El Nino-Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) and the associated changes with
the Pacific-North American teleconnection pattern,
and with the North Atlantic Oscillation. In the
tropical Pacific during large El Nino events the
anomalous divergence of the atmospheric energy
transports exceeds 50 W m(-2) over broad regions for
several months. Examination of the corresponding
top-of-the-atmosphere net radiative fluxes shows
that it is primarily the surface fluxes from the
ocean to the atmosphere that feed the divergent
atmospheric transports. A systematic investigation
of the covariability of sea surface temperatures
(SSTs) and the divergence of atmospheric energy
transport, using singular value decomposition
analysis of the temporal covariance, reveals ENSO as
dominant in the first two modes, explaining 62{\%} and
12{\%} of the covariance in the Pacific domain and
explaining 39.5{\%} and 15.4{\%} globally for the first
and second modes, respectively. The first mode is
well represented by the time series for the SST
index for Nino 3.4 region (170degreesW-120degreesW,
5degreesN-5degreesS). Regression analysis allows a
more complete view of how the SSTs, outgoing
longwave radiation, precipitation, diabatic heating,
and atmospheric circulation respond with ENSO. The
second mode indicates aspects of the systematic
evolution of ENSO with time, with strong lead and
lag correlations. It primarily reflects differences
in the evolution of ENSO across the tropical Pacific
from about the dateline to coastal South
America. High SSTs associated with warm ENSO events
are damped through surface heat fluxes into the
atmosphere, which transports the energy into higher

The role of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in modulating this response is discussed by differentiating easterly and westerly QBO years. The remote influence of Siberian snow anomalies is found to be weak in the models, especially in the stratosphere where the “Holton–Tan” effect of the QBO dominates the simulated snow influence on the polar vortex. At the surface, discrepancies between composite analyses from observations and model results question the causal relationship between snow and the atmospheric circulation, suggesting that the atmosphere might have driven snow anomalies rather than the other way around. When both forcings are combined, the simulations suggest destructive interference between the response to positive snow anomalies and easterly QBO (and vice versa), at odds with the hypothesis that the s...},

abstract = {Traces of environmental conditions found in natural archives can serve as proxies for direct climate measurements to extend our knowledge of past climate variability beyond the relatively short instrumental record. Such paleoclimate proxies have demonstrated significant multidecadal climate variability in the Atlantic sector since at least the mid-1700s. However, Atlantic multidecadal climate variability is primarily defined by fluctuations in sea surface temperature (SST) and the proxy evidence comes from a variety of sources, many of which are terrestrial and are not directly recording sea surface temperature. Further analysis into the causes and consequences of Atlantic multidecadal climate variability requires development of a spatial network of decadal resolution proxy SST records with both low and high latitude contributions. An initial attempt at a low latitude Atlantic SST reconstruction found only 4 sites with ≤5year resolution data, demonstrating the paucity of appropriate data available. The 4-site average correlated significantly with instrumental average SST and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The full record, 1360–2000C.E., and a shortened version 1460–1850C.E., had significant multidecadal variability centered at a 60-year period. Comparing our reconstruction with reconstructions of SST anomalies in the North Atlantic shows that there is no consensus yet on the history of Atlantic multidecadal variability.},

The first harmonic is associated with maximum global AAM in winter (December– January–February) and minimum in summer, but the second harmonic is important enough to produce a distinct secondary midwinter minimum. Locally, the second harmonic has largest amplitude in the Tropics and subtropics of the upper troposphere. At present, little is known concerning the fundamental cause of this semiannual variation. The problem is investigated here by focusing on the upper-tropospheric winds, whose angular momentum is an excellent proxy of global AAM. The annual variation of the rotational part of these winds (the part that contributes to the global AAM) is diagnosed in a nonlinear upper-tropospheric vorticity-equation model with specified horizontal wind divergence and transient-eddy forcing. The divergence forcing is the more important of the two, especially in the Tropics and sub...},

flowering, and leaf coloring, are closely associated
with lower atmospheric conditions as seasons
change. Plant phenology during springtime is
particularly sensitive to climatic factors,
especially temperature variations. Therefore, the
occurrence of specific plant events can be used to
identify the onset of spring. Advance or delay in
these timings can serve as potential climate change
detection measures over long periods. In this paper,
changes to spring's onset in Wisconsin were examined
using the first-bloom event of several introduced
and native species in t965-1998. Due to the
incompleteness of these observations, satellite data
were applied to derive 3 phenological regions across
the state. Next, average first-bloom time-series
were formed at this regional scale. Several
multi-species indices were then created based on
regional first-bloom variations. Trends toward
earlier first-bloom dates over the study period,
especially for early-spring species, were revealed
in the southwestern and central/eastern regions of
Wisconsin. Two of the most important aspects of our
study are: (1) phenology is regarded as a
multi-species problem that can be more easily
manipulated by reducing species variations to
several indices; and (2) satellite data, weather
data, and phenological observations are integrated
to create and validate phenological regions, a
process that can be used in other areas to
facilitate long-term phenological data

Results from the individual forcing experiments are then linearly combined using a statistically based smoothing procedure to produce sensitivity maps for many target quantities of interest, including the geopotential height response over the Pacific–North American (PNA) region and regional precipitation responses over North America, South America, Africa, Australia, and Indonesia. Perhaps the most striking result from this analysis is that many important targets for seasonal forecasting, including the PNA response, are most sensitive to SST anomalies in the Ni{\~{n}}o-4 region (5°N–5°S, 150°W–160°E) of the central tropical Pacific, with lesser and sometimes opposite s...},

@article{oglesby12,
abstract = {During medieval times (900-1300 AD; henceforth MT),
persistent drought ('megadrought') was a ubiquitous
feature for much of North America. To better
understand the mechanisms for these droughts,
relationships between specific sea surface
temperatures (SSTs) and drought in North America
have been synthesized from previous studies using
modern observations, proxy paleo-data, and
simulations from multiple climate models. Particular
focus is on the role of the Atlantic Multidecadal
Oscillation (AMO), a roughly 60-80 year fluctuation
in the North Atlantic between relatively warm ('warm
phase') and cool ('cold phase') SSTs. Present-day
relationships, for which instrumental observations
can be used, indicate that persistent droughts in
the U.S. Great Plains and Southwest are closely
related to AMO. During AMO warm (cold) phases, most
of North America is dry (wet). The MT drought is
closely related to AMO-like warm phases in the North
Atlantic. However, the MT drought is just one of
numerous droughts on centennial timescales affected
by the AMO that new results from the proxy record
indicate impacted North America during the
Holocene. The influence of North Atlantic SST on
modern North American drought is examined using
simulations made by global climate models. When
forced by warm North Atlantic SST anomalies, all
models captured significant drying over North
America, despite some regional differences. Overall,
the ensemble of the 5 models could well reproduce
the statistical relationship between the dry/wet
fluctuations in the North America and North Atlantic
SST anomalies. Using one particular climate model,
we further demonstrated that warm North Atlantic SST
anomalies might have played a major role in the MT
drought over much of North America. The MT drought
could be simulated either by perpetual La Nina-like
conditions in the eastern Pacific or warm phase of
the AMO in the North Atlantic. Best match to proxy
reconstructions was obtained, however, when both La
Nina and warm phase AMO conditions were
imposed. During the warm phase of AMO, the
subtropical high is displaced north and east of its
mean location, reducing moisture transport into the
US except along the mid-Atlantic coast. During the
cool phase, the subtropical high strengthens and
pushes westward, allowing for more moisture
transport into the central and western US. In
summary, the AMO modulates the large-scale
circulation to be more (less) conducive to
precipitation over the central and western
U.S. during cold (warm) phases. Its effects must be
considered along with other, shorter time-scale
factors such as ENSO, or PDO, as well as local
effects that affect land surface-atmosphere
interactions, such as soil moisture. (C) 2011

in the context of the past two centuries. Nine
annually resolved paleoclimate proxy records from
the Australasian region are used to develop a
reconstruction of streamflow from 1783 to 1988. An
ensemble of reconstructions is presented, providing
probabilistic estimates of River Murray flows for
each year back in time. The best-estimate
reconstruction captures approximately 23{\%} (50{\%}) of
annual (decadal) naturalized streamflow
variability. High and low streamflow phases and
their association with decadal climate variability
in the Pacific are discussed. Reconstructed River
Murray streamflow shows considerable variation since
1783. We estimate that there is a 2.3{\%} chance that
the 1998-2008 record low decadal streamflow deficit
has been exceeded since European
settlement. Stochastic simulations of the decadal
variations in River Murray streamflow are computed
using the paleostreamflow reconstruction to estimate
model parameters. From these simulations, we
estimate that the 1998-2008 streamflow deficit has
an approximate 1 in 1500 year return period. As
climate models are assessed relative to short
instrumental records, future projections of
decadal-scale variations in Murray-Darling Basin
(MDB) streamflow may be inadequately
represented. Given the immense socioeconomic
importance of Australia's "food bowl," future
paleoclimate and modeling efforts should be directed
at understanding variability at this scale. This
would greatly enhance our capacity to estimate
regional sensitivity of the MDB's hydroclimate to
further anthropogenic influences.},

abstract = {A mechanism exists whereby global greenhouse warning could, by intensifying the alongshore wind stress on the ocean surface, lead to acceleration of coastal upwelling. Evidence from several different regions suggests that the major coastal upwelling systems of the world have been growing in upwelling intensity as greenhouse gases have accumulated in the earth's atmosphere. Thus the cool foggy summer conditions that typify the coastlands of northern California and other similar upwelling regions might, under global warming, become even more pronounced. Effects of enhanced upwelling on the marine ecosystem are uncertain but potentially dramatic.},
